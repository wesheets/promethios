# 💰 Most Cost-Effective Native LLM Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This guide provides the most economical path to implementing a governance-native LLM for Promethios. Instead of training from scratch ($10K-$50K), we'll use fine-tuning approaches that cost $50-$500 and can be completed in days rather than weeks.

## 📊 Cost Comparison

|----------|------|------|------------|------------|
| **Full Training** | $10K-$50K | 2-4 weeks | Very High | Maximum |
| **Fine-tuning (Recommended)** | $50-$500 | 2-7 days | Medium | 80% of full training |
| **LoRA Fine-tuning** | $20-$100 | 1-3 days | Low | 60% of full training |
| **Prompt Engineering** | $5-$20 | 1 day | Very Low | 40% of full training |
