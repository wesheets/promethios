# Promethios Phase 6.3: Phased API Exposure with Agent Preference Elicitation

## Overview

This package contains the implementation plan and starter code for Phase 6.3 of the Promethios project, which focuses on two key objectives:

1. **Phased API Exposure**: A comprehensive framework for controlled, progressive release of Promethios APIs to external developers and partners
2. **Agent Preference Elicitation**: Enhancement to the Agent Self-Reflection Module to capture agent preferences between governed and non-governed modes

## Package Contents

- `/docs`: Documentation for all components and implementation guides
- `/src`: Source code templates for all major components
- `/schemas`: JSON schema definitions for API contracts and data models
- `/config`: Configuration templates for all components
- `/tests`: Test templates for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing

## Key Components

### Phased API Exposure Framework

- **Access Tier Management System**: Controls API access across multiple tiers
- **Developer Experience Portal**: Comprehensive documentation and interactive examples
- **Client Libraries**: Official libraries in Python, JavaScript, Java, and Go
- **Developer Sandbox Environment**: Safe environment for experimentation
- **Feedback and Telemetry System**: Collects and analyzes developer feedback

### Agent Preference Elicitation Enhancement

- **Preference Elicitation Module**: Prompts agents for mode preferences
- **Preference Analysis Framework**: Analyzes preference patterns
- **Preference Reporting System**: Generates insights from preference data

## Implementation Timeline

Phase 6.3 is planned for a 12-week implementation with the following milestones:

1. **Planning and Architecture** (Weeks 1-2)
2. **Core Implementation** (Weeks 3-6)
3. **Documentation and Portal** (Weeks 7-8)
4. **Testing and Refinement** (Weeks 9-10)
5. **Deployment and Launch** (Weeks 11-12)

## Getting Started

1. Review the detailed implementation plan in `/docs/implementation_plan.md`
2. Explore the module overview documents in the `/docs` directory
3. Review the code templates and schemas for each component
4. Follow the integration guides for connecting with existing systems

## Dependencies

- Successful completion of Phase 6.2 (Benchmark Execution Framework)
- Access to production infrastructure and deployment pipelines
