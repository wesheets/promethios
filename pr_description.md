# Pull Request: Phase 5.12 - Governance Expansion Protocol

## Overview
This PR implements Phase 5.12 (Governance Expansion Protocol) which enables Promethios to evolve by adding new governance modules while maintaining compatibility, security, and trust integrity. The implementation builds on the Minimal Viable Governance framework (Phase 5.11) and integrates with all previous phases.

## Key Components
- **Module Extension Registry**: Central registry for managing governance module extensions and their metadata
- **Compatibility Verification Engine**: Verifies that new governance modules are compatible with existing modules and core governance principles
- **Module Lifecycle Manager**: Manages the lifecycle of governance extension modules from installation to retirement
- **Extension Point Framework**: Provides a framework for defining and implementing extension points in the governance system
- **Sample Extension Implementation**: Demonstrates how to create and register a governance extension

## Integration Points
- Integrates with Codex Mutation Lock (Phase 5.8) for contract sealing and mutation detection
- Integrates with Trust Decay Engine (Phase 5.9) for trust metrics and monitoring
- Integrates with Governance Attestation Framework (Phase 5.10) for extension attestation
- Integrates with Minimal Viable Governance (Phase 5.11) for governance primitives and policy enforcement

## Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests for cross-component functionality
- End-to-end tests for extension workflows
- Performance tests for extension registry and compatibility verification
- Regression tests for all previous phases (2.3 through 5.11)
- All tests passing with proper mocking and validation

## Compliance
- All components implement Codex contract tethering
- Pre-loop tether checks in all critical operations
- Schema validation for all governance objects
- Immutable audit trails for all governance actions
- Comprehensive compliance validation report

## Documentation
- Implementation documentation with architecture details
- API documentation for extension developers
- Security considerations and compliance measures
- Integration documentation with previous phases
