# Pull Request: Phase 5.11 - Minimal Viable Governance

## Overview
This PR implements Phase 5.11 (Minimal Viable Governance) which provides a comprehensive governance framework for the Promethios system. The implementation includes core governance primitives, decision framework, policy management, and requirement validation components.

## Key Components
- **Governance Primitive Manager**: Manages governance primitives (constraints, rules, directives, controls, standards)
- **Decision Framework Engine**: Provides flexible decision-making with multiple voting models
- **Policy Management Module**: Manages governance policies with enforcement and exemption handling
- **Requirement Validation Module**: Validates system components against governance requirements

## Integration Points
- Integrates with Codex Mutation Lock (Phase 5.8) for contract tethering
- Integrates with Trust Decay Engine (Phase 5.9) for trust-based governance
- Integrates with Governance Attestation Framework (Phase 5.10) for attestation verification

## Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests for cross-component functionality
- All tests passing with proper mocking and validation

## Compliance
- All components implement Codex contract tethering
- Pre-loop tether checks in all critical operations
- Schema validation for all governance objects
- Immutable audit trails for all governance actions

## Documentation
- Implementation documentation with architecture details
- Security considerations and compliance measures
- Integration documentation with previous phases
