# Phase 5.8: Codex Mutation Lock

## Codex Contract References
- **Contract Version**: v2025.05.20
- **Phase ID**: 5.8
- **Phase Title**: Codex Mutation Lock
- **Clauses**: 5.8, 11.0, 11.1, 11.4

## Summary
This PR implements Phase 5.8 (Codex Mutation Lock) according to the Codex Contract requirements. The implementation introduces mechanisms to lock contract changes, prevent silent alterations of trust state after external exposure, and formalize the contract evolution protocol.

## Components Implemented

### Core Components
- **ContractSealer**: Creates and verifies cryptographic seals of contracts
- **EvolutionProtocol**: Manages the process of evolving contracts through a formal approval process
- **MutationDetector**: Detects unauthorized modifications to sealed contracts
- **CodexLock**: Main implementation that ties everything together

### Integration Components
- **CodexLockAPI**: API integration for the Codex Lock system

## Schema Definitions
- **contract_seal.schema.v1.json**: Defines structure for contract seals
- **evolution_proposal.schema.v1.json**: Defines structure for evolution proposals
- **evolution_record.schema.v1.json**: Defines structure for evolution records
- **mutation_detection.schema.v1.json**: Defines structure for mutation detection results

## Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests for all components
- End-to-end tests for the full evolution workflow
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- All tests pass successfully

## Documentation
- Comprehensive implementation documentation in `Phase_5_8_Implementation_Documentation.md`
- Code-level documentation with detailed comments
- Schema documentation with field descriptions and examples

## Governance Compliance
- Updated `.codex.lock` with Phase 5.8 entries
- Updated `module_registry.json` with new components
- All components implement Codex contract tethering
- All data is validated against schemas
- All operations are logged for auditability

## Integration Points
- Integrates with Phase 5.7 (Trust Surface Visualization) by providing immutable contract references
- Prepares for Phase 5.9 (Trust Decay Engine) by establishing immutable contract references
- Implements Codex contract tethering according to Phase 11.0 (Governance Framework)

## Implementation Notes
- The CodexLock implementation defaults to requiring 2 approvals for evolution proposals
- The system distinguishes between invalid seals and state modifications, but reports all mutations as "STATE_MODIFIED" for consistency
- All components follow the canonical repository structure

## Reviewers
Please review the implementation for:
1. Compliance with Codex Contract requirements
2. Schema validation throughout the system
3. Evolution protocol correctness
4. Mutation detection accuracy
5. Test coverage and quality
