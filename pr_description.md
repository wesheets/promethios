# Pull Request: Phase 5.13 - Trust Boundary Definition

## Overview

This PR implements Phase 5.13 (Trust Boundary Definition) of the Promethios project. The Trust Boundary Definition framework enables Promethios to define, manage, and verify trust boundaries within the system, ensuring that trust guarantees are maintained across different domains and that boundary crossings are properly controlled and verified.

## Key Components

### Schema Definitions
- Trust Boundary Schema (`schemas/trust/trust_boundary.schema.v1.json`)
- Boundary Crossing Schema (`schemas/trust/boundary_crossing.schema.v1.json`)
- Boundary Integrity Schema (`schemas/verification/boundary_integrity.schema.v1.json`)
- Trust Domain Schema (`schemas/trust/trust_domain.schema.v1.json`)

### Core Components
- Boundary Detection Engine (`src/core/trust/boundary_detection_engine.py`)
- Boundary Crossing Protocol (`src/core/trust/boundary_crossing_protocol.py`)
- Boundary Integrity Verifier (`src/core/verification/boundary_integrity_verifier.py`)
- Trust Domain Manager (`src/core/trust/trust_domain_manager.py`)
- Sample Boundary Definitions (`src/core/trust/sample_boundary_definitions.py`)

### Integration Components
- Boundary Management API
- Boundary Visualization Integration
- Trust Domain Explorer

## Implementation Details

### Boundary Detection Engine
The Boundary Detection Engine is responsible for detecting, registering, and managing trust boundaries within the system. It provides capabilities for:
- Registering new boundaries with proper schema validation and contract tethering
- Updating existing boundaries while maintaining integrity
- Adding entry and exit points to boundaries
- Adding controls to boundaries for security and governance
- Querying and listing boundaries based on various criteria

### Boundary Crossing Protocol
The Boundary Crossing Protocol manages the interactions between different trust boundaries. It provides capabilities for:
- Registering boundary crossings with proper validation and contract tethering
- Validating crossings against security and governance requirements
- Adding controls to crossings for security and governance
- Monitoring and auditing boundary crossings

### Boundary Integrity Verifier
The Boundary Integrity Verifier ensures that trust boundaries maintain their integrity over time. It provides capabilities for:
- Verifying the integrity of boundaries and their crossings
- Detecting mutations and violations of boundaries
- Reporting and remediating boundary violations
- Providing recommendations for improving boundary integrity

### Trust Domain Manager
The Trust Domain Manager manages trust domains, which are logical groupings of components that share common trust characteristics. It provides capabilities for:
- Registering and managing trust domains
- Associating domains with boundaries
- Managing relationships between domains
- Calculating trust levels for domains
- Managing domain evolution through merging and splitting

## Integration Points

### Integration with Governance Framework
The Trust Boundary Definition framework integrates with the Governance Framework (Phases 5.10 and 5.11) to ensure that trust boundaries and domains are governed according to established policies and requirements.

### Integration with Module Extension System
The Trust Boundary Definition framework integrates with the Module Extension System (Phase 5.12) to support extensibility and customization.

### Integration with Trust Decay Engine
The Trust Boundary Definition framework integrates with the Trust Decay Engine (Phase 5.9) to model trust decay over time.

## Testing

Comprehensive testing has been implemented for all components:
- Unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests for boundary management and visualization
- End-to-end tests for boundary crossing and integrity workflows
- Performance tests for boundary detection and crossing
- Regression tests for all previous phases (2.3 through 5.12)

## Compliance and Governance

All components implement proper Codex contract tethering and schema validation:
- Creating cryptographic seals for all boundary, crossing, verification, and domain definitions
- Verifying seals when retrieving or using these definitions
- Verifying contract tethers to ensure the definitions have not been tampered with
- Validating all data structures against their respective schemas

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been created:
- Implementation documentation (`Phase_5_13_Implementation_Documentation.md`)
- API documentation
- Integration documentation with previous phases
- Security considerations and governance compliance measures

## Checklist

- [x] All schema definitions are implemented and validated
- [x] All core components are implemented with proper contract tethering
- [x] All integration components are implemented and tested
