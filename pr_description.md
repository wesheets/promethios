# Pull Request: Phase 5.10 - Governance Attestation Framework

## Overview

This PR implements Phase 5.10 of the Promethios project: the Governance Attestation Framework. This framework introduces a comprehensive system for creating, verifying, and managing cryptographically signed attestations within the Promethios governance ecosystem.

## Key Components

1. **Attestation Service**: Provides cryptographic signature generation, validation, and attestation chain management
2. **Claim Verification Protocol**: Enables creation and verification of governance claims through evidence and attestations
3. **Governance Audit Trail**: Implements Merkle tree-based immutable audit records for governance decisions
4. **Attestation Authority Manager**: Handles registration, verification, and trust management of attestation authorities

## Integration Points

- Integrates with the Trust Decay Engine (Phase 5.9) for trust scoring and regeneration
- Leverages the Codex Mutation Lock (Phase 5.8) for contract state verification
- Extends the Trust Surface Visualization (Phase 5.7) with attestation dashboards

## Governance Compliance

All components implement:
- Codex Contract Tethering with proper contract IDs and versions
- Pre-loop tether checks before any operations
- Schema validation against canonical schemas
- Immutable audit trail integration
- Trust level enforcement for operations

## Testing

- Comprehensive unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests for API and cross-component functionality
- All tests passing with 100% success rate

## Documentation

- Detailed implementation documentation in Phase_5_10_Implementation_Documentation.md
- Schema definitions with sample data for validation
- Integration documentation with previous phases

## Security Considerations

- All attestations are cryptographically signed
- Support for authority key rotation and revocation
- Trust thresholds for attestation validation
- Time-bound attestations with expiration
- Tamper-evident audit trail with Merkle proofs
