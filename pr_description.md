# Implement Hash Embedding and Chain Integrity for Governance Logs

## Summary
This PR implements hash embedding and chain integrity for Promethios governance logs, addressing the critical gap identified during Phase 2.3.2 testing. The implementation ensures that all log entries include SHA256 hashes calculated at write-time and maintains chain integrity through previous entry hash references.

## Changes
- Added hash calculation and embedding in `governance_core.py` log writing functions
- Implemented chain integrity with `previous_entry_hash` fields (Phase 11.0 preview)
- Updated `verify_log_hashes.py` utility to validate embedded hashes and chain integrity
- Enhanced UI log parsing utilities to display and verify embedded hashes
- Added schema validation script for comprehensive log compliance testing

## Testing
All tests have passed successfully:
- ✅ Hash embedding in log writes
- ✅ Deterministic replay test
- ✅ Log generation in canonical location
- ✅ SHA256 manifest generation
- ✅ Hash integrity verification
- ✅ /loop/execute endpoint functionality
- ✅ Log schema compliance
- ✅ UI component integration

A comprehensive test report is included in the PR.

## Impact
This implementation ensures that Promethios can be showcased as a governance-first kernel with robust audit capabilities in tomorrow's developer demo. It provides:

1. Verifiable log integrity through embedded SHA256 hashes
2. Chain integrity for audit trail verification
3. UI integration for hash verification display
4. Foundation for future cryptographic enhancements (Phase 11.x)

## Next Steps
After merging this PR:
1. Prepare for Phase 5.1 development
2. Consider future enhancements outlined in the implementation guide:
   - Phase 11.0: Enhance with full immutable log chain and sequential hashing
   - Phase 11.1: Add cryptographic witness protocol
   - Phase 11.2: Integrate formal verification hooks
   - Phase 11.3: Implement governance metadata registry
