# Phase 5.6: Distributed Trust Surface Implementation

## Codex Contract Reference
- **Contract Version:** v2025.05.18
- **Phase ID:** 5.6
- **Clauses:** 5.6, 5.5, 5.4, 11.0, 11.1, 5.2.6

## Summary
This pull request implements the Distributed Trust Surface (Phase 5.6) for the Promethios platform, enabling secure and verifiable trust relationships between distributed instances. The implementation follows the canonical repository structure established in Phase 5.2.6.1 and integrates with the Governance Mesh (Phase 5.5) and Distributed Verification Network (Phase 5.4).

## Key Components
1. **Trust Boundary Manager** (`src/core/governance/trust_boundary_manager.py`)
   - Defines and enforces trust boundaries between Promethios instances
   - Manages trust level assignment and updates
   - Implements boundary policy enforcement

2. **Trust Surface Protocol** (`src/core/governance/trust_surface_protocol.py`)
   - Defines communication protocol for trust surface interactions
   - Handles message signing and verification
   - Processes boundary and attestation requests

3. **Attestation Service** (`src/core/governance/attestation_service.py`)
   - Generates and validates trust attestations
   - Manages attestation chains
   - Handles attestation revocation

4. **Trust Propagation Engine** (`src/core/governance/trust_propagation_engine.py`)
   - Manages trust propagation across the network
   - Implements trust decay and reinforcement mechanisms
   - Handles trust conflicts and resolution

5. **Boundary Enforcement Module** (`src/core/governance/boundary_enforcement_module.py`)
   - Enforces trust boundary policies and access control
   - Implements attestation requirement enforcement
   - Logs and audits enforcement actions

## Schema Definitions
- **Trust Boundary Schema** (`src/schemas/governance/trust_boundary.schema.v1.json`)
- **Trust Attestation Schema** (`src/schemas/governance/trust_attestation.schema.v1.json`)
- **Trust Surface Protocol Schema** (`src/schemas/governance/trust_surface_protocol.schema.v1.json`)

## Testing
All components have comprehensive test coverage:
- 40 unit and integration tests
- Schema validation tests
- Codex compliance tests

## Documentation
Detailed implementation documentation is provided in `Phase_5_6_Implementation_Documentation.md`, including:
- Component architecture and interactions
- Integration points with other phases
- Usage examples
- Deployment considerations

## Governance Compliance
This PR follows the governance process established in `pr_governance_process.md`:
- Created from a feature branch named `phase-5.6`
- Includes detailed PR description referencing the Codex Contract
- All tests pass and schema validations are successful
- Implementation follows the canonical repository structure

## Integration Points
- Integrates with Governance Mesh (Phase 5.5) for trust boundary synchronization
- Integrates with Distributed Verification Network (Phase 5.4) for attestation verification
- Leverages Merkle Sealing (Phase 5.3) for tamper-proof verification

## Reviewers
Please review this implementation for:
- Functional correctness
- Codex Contract compliance
- Code quality and maintainability
- Documentation completeness
- Integration with existing components
