# Phase 5.7: Trust Surface Visualization and Analytics

## Codex Contract References
- **Contract Version**: v2025.05.19
- **Phase ID**: 5.7
- **Phase Title**: Trust Surface Visualization and Analytics
- **UI Component**: UI-12.66 (Trust Surface Dashboard)
- **Clauses**: 5.7, 5.6, 11.0, 11.1, 11.4, 12.25, 12.66

## Summary
This PR implements Phase 5.7 (Trust Surface Visualization and Analytics) and UI-12.66 (Trust Surface Dashboard) according to the Codex Contract requirements. The implementation extends the Distributed Trust Surface established in Phase 5.6 with analytics capabilities and visualization tools.

## Components Implemented

### Core Components
- **Trust Surface Analytics Engine**: Processes trust surface data to generate metrics and detect anomalies
- **Trust Metrics Aggregator**: Collects and normalizes metrics from multiple nodes
- **Visualization Data Transformer**: Prepares trust data for visualization consumption

### UI Components (UI-12.66)
- **Trust Surface Dashboard**: Main entry point for the dashboard UI
- **Surface View**: Interactive visualization of trust surfaces and boundaries
- **Metrics Panel**: Display of key trust metrics and indicators
- **Boundary Alerts**: Notifications for trust boundary violations
- **Trend Charts**: Visualization of historical trust data
- **Dashboard Layout**: Overall layout and structure of the dashboard

## Schema Definitions
- **trust_metrics.schema.v1.json**: Defines structure for trust metrics data
- **trust_boundary_alert.schema.v1.json**: Defines structure for boundary violation alerts
- **trust_visualization.schema.v1.json**: Defines structure for visualization data

## Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests for all components with >90% coverage
- Integration tests for the end-to-end analytics pipeline
- Schema validation tests throughout the pipeline
- UI component tests for rendering and data binding

## Documentation
- Comprehensive implementation documentation in `Phase_5_7_Implementation_Documentation.md`
- Code-level documentation with detailed comments
- Schema documentation with field descriptions and examples

## Governance Compliance
- Updated `.codex.lock` with Phase 5.7 and UI-12.66 entries
- Updated `module_registry.json` with new components
- All components implement Codex contract tethering
- All data is validated against schemas
- All operations are logged for auditability

## Integration Points
- Integrates with Phase 5.6 (Distributed Trust Surface) components
- Leverages trust boundary definitions and attestation chains
- Implements UI-12.66 (Trust Surface Dashboard) according to specifications

## Reviewers
Please review the implementation for:
1. Compliance with Codex Contract requirements
2. Schema validation throughout the pipeline
3. UI component functionality and responsiveness
4. Integration with Phase 5.6 components
5. Test coverage and quality
