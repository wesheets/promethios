# Technical Debt Documentation for Promethios Phase 6.5

## Overview

This document outlines technical debt identified during the implementation of Phase 6.5 (Domain-Specific Governance Profiles). These items are documented for future resolution in subsequent phases.

## Trust Log UI Component Test Failures

The trust_log UI components have several test failures that should be addressed in a future phase. These components are peripheral to the core domain-specific governance profiles implementation and do not impact the main functionality of Phase 6.5.

### Current Status

- 18 failing tests in the trust_log test suite
- 8 passing tests (primarily in the core domain-specific governance profile components)

### Specific Issues

1. **Missing ajv Library Integration**
   - The TrustSurfaceDisplay.js and other components reference an undefined 'ajv' variable
   - Schema validation is attempted but fails due to missing library
   - Temporary workaround: Schema validation has been mocked for testing

2. **React/JSX in JavaScript Files**
   - The trust_log components use JSX in .js files rather than .tsx
   - Babel transformation issues occur despite configuration updates
   - Requires comprehensive Jest/Babel configuration update

3. **Component Lifecycle and Async Testing Issues**
   - Tests have timing issues with asynchronous operations
   - Component mounting/unmounting not properly handled in tests
   - Requires more robust test setup with proper mocking

## Recommended Actions for Future Phases

1. **Refactor Trust Log Components**
   - Convert .js files to .tsx for better TypeScript integration
   - Properly import and integrate ajv library
   - Update component lifecycle methods to modern React patterns

2. **Improve Test Infrastructure**
   - Create dedicated test utilities for mocking external dependencies
   - Implement proper async test patterns with act() and waitFor()
   - Add comprehensive mocking for fetch and other browser APIs

3. **Update Build Configuration**
   - Refine Jest configuration for mixed JS/TS environments
   - Ensure Babel presets are properly configured for all file types
   - Add ESLint rules to prevent similar issues in the future

## Impact Assessment

The identified technical debt does not impact the core functionality of the domain-specific governance profiles implementation. All critical components for Phase 6.5 are working correctly and have passing tests.

This technical debt should be addressed in a future phase to ensure long-term maintainability of the codebase.
