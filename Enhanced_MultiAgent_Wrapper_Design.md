- Review & Create

### **Enhanced Multi-Agent Wrapper (Post-Demo Insights)**

## New Configuration Options

### **1. Collaboration Model (New Step)**
**Location:** Between "Basic Info" and "Agent Selection"

#### **Shared Context**
- All agents see full conversation history
- Natural coordination through shared awareness
- Best for: Complex problem-solving, creative collaboration
- Governance: Trust verification at each contribution

#### **Sequential Handoffs**
- Agents work in defined order with explicit handoffs
- Each agent builds on previous agent's work
- Best for: Workflows with clear dependencies
- Governance: Handoff validation and quality gates

#### **Parallel Processing**
- Agents work independently on different aspects
- Results combined at the end
- Best for: Large tasks that can be divided
- Governance: Individual validation + result synthesis

#### **Hierarchical Coordination**
- Lead agent coordinates and delegates to sub-agents
- Clear command structure and responsibility
- Best for: Complex projects with management needs
- Governance: Authority validation and delegation tracking

#### **Consensus Decision**
- Agents discuss and vote on decisions
- Requires agreement before proceeding
- Best for: High-stakes decisions requiring validation
- Governance: Voting protocols and conflict resolution

### **2. Enhanced System Types**
**Updated dropdown options:**

#### **Sequential**
- One agent completes before next starts
- Clear handoff points and dependencies
- Linear workflow progression

#### **Parallel**
- Multiple agents work simultaneously
- Independent task execution
- Results aggregated at completion

#### **Conditional**
- Agents triggered by specific conditions
- Dynamic workflow based on context
- Rule-based agent activation

#### **Hybrid**
- Combination of sequential and parallel
- Complex workflows with multiple patterns
- Flexible coordination models

#### **Event-Driven**
- Agents respond to real-time events
- Reactive coordination patterns
- Dynamic team formation

#### **Custom**
- User-defined workflow patterns
- Advanced configuration options
- Full control over coordination logic

## Governance Configuration Requirements

### **Pre-Deployment Governance Setup**

#### **Trust Management**
- **Minimum Trust Thresholds**: What trust score required for decisions?
- **Trust Verification Protocols**: How is trust validated between agents?
- **Trust Recovery Mechanisms**: How do agents rebuild trust after failures?

#### **Policy Compliance**
- **Required Policies**: Which policies must all agents follow?
- **Compliance Validation**: How is policy adherence verified?
- **Violation Handling**: What happens when policies are violated?

#### **Quality Assurance**
- **Quality Gates**: What checkpoints must be passed?
- **Validation Criteria**: How is work quality measured?
- **Rework Protocols**: How are quality failures handled?

#### **Conflict Resolution**
- **Disagreement Protocols**: How are agent conflicts resolved?
- **Escalation Procedures**: When and how to escalate conflicts?
- **Final Authority**: Who/what makes final decisions?

#### **Audit and Compliance**
- **Logging Requirements**: What interactions must be logged?
- **Audit Trail Standards**: How detailed must records be?
- **Compliance Reporting**: What reports are generated?

## Why This Matters for Production

### **Independent Operation**
Once deployed, the multi-agent system must operate without human oversight:
- **Governance rules** become the "operating system" for agent coordination
- **Trust mechanisms** ensure reliable agent interactions
- **Quality gates** maintain output standards
- **Conflict resolution** handles disagreements automatically

### **Scalability and Reliability**
Production systems need robust governance:
- **Consistent behavior** across different scenarios
- **Predictable outcomes** even in edge cases
- **Graceful degradation** when agents fail
- **Audit trails** for compliance and debugging

### **Security and Compliance**
Deployed systems must meet enterprise requirements:
- **Policy enforcement** without human intervention
- **Audit trails** for regulatory compliance
- **Security protocols** for sensitive operations
- **Access controls** for system modifications

This enhanced wrapper ensures that deployed multi-agent systems are production-ready with comprehensive governance frameworks.
