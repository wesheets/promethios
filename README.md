# Promethios Kernel Bundle - README

This bundle contains the Codex-validated core components of the Promethios Resurrection Kernel, prepared for runtime initialization. It is essential that all steps are followed carefully to maintain the integrity and governance established by the Resurrection Codex.

The presence of the `.codex.lock` file signifies that all contents herein are bound by the rules and schemas defined in the `CODEX_MANIFEST.md` and its associated schema registry.

## 1. Operator Actions: GitHub Repository Initialization

As the Operator, you are responsible for initializing the `promethios` GitHub repository and committing these foundational files. This manual step ensures a clear audit trail and maintains strict control over the codebase.

### 1.1. Repository Setup and Initial Commit Checklist:

*   [ ] **Create a new GitHub Repository:**
    *   Name: `promethios` (or as per your naming convention).
    *   Visibility: Private (recommended initially) or Public.
    *   Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license at this stage (to avoid conflicts).
*   [ ] **Clone the empty repository to your local machine:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-new-repo-url>
    cd promethios
    ```
*   [ ] **Extract Bundle Contents:**
    *   Extract the contents of `promethios_kernel_bundle.zip` directly into your cloned `promethios` repository directory. The expected structure after extraction should be:
        ```
        /promethios
        ├── .codex.lock
        ├── CODEX_MANIFEST.md
        ├── governance_core.py
        ├── loop_runtime_test_harness.py
        ├── README.md (this file)
        └── schemas/
            ├── loop_justification_log.schema.v1.json
            ├── mgc_emotion_telemetry.schema.json
            ├── mgc_loop_control.schema.json
            ├── mgc_memory_surface_interface.schema.json
            └── operator_override.schema.v1.json
        ```
*   [ ] **Verify Files:**
    *   Ensure all listed files and the `schemas` directory are present.
    *   Confirm no other files were accidentally introduced.
*   [ ] **Stage and Commit Files:**
    *   Add all files to Git staging:
        ```bash
        git add .
        ```
    *   Commit the files with a clear message:
        ```bash
        git commit -m "Resurrected Kernel: Initial commit of Codex-validated GovernanceCore and foundational artifacts"
        ```
*   [ ] **Push to GitHub:**
    *   Push the initial commit to the main branch on GitHub:
        ```bash
        git push origin main  # Or your default branch name
        ```

## 2. Governance and Future Contributions (Builder Manus)

With this initial commit, the `promethios` repository is established under the strict governance of the Resurrection Codex.

*   **Codex Enforcement:** All future code, configuration changes, or additions to this repository MUST adhere to the schemas, contracts, and principles defined in the `CODEX_MANIFEST.md`.
*   **Builder Manus Workflow:** Subsequent development work, anticipated to be performed by a "Builder Manus" entity, will be managed through detailed batch plans generated by Architect Manus.
*   **Pull Request (PR) Process for Builder Manus Contributions:**
    *   Builder Manus will provide completed work as patches or file sets based on approved batch plans.
    *   The Operator (you) will be responsible for creating Pull Requests on GitHub with these changes.
    *   **Operator PR Checklist (for Builder Manus contributions):**
        *   [ ] **Verify Batch Plan Alignment:** Confirm the changes in the PR directly correspond to an approved batch plan from Architect Manus.
        *   [ ] **Codex Validation:** Ensure all new or modified code and schemas pass validation against the Resurrection Codex (this may involve running local validation scripts or checks provided by Architect Manus).
        *   [ ] **Schema Adherence:** Confirm that any new data structures or interfaces strictly adhere to existing or newly (and correctly) registered schemas.
        *   [ ] **Test Harness Execution:** If applicable, ensure any associated tests (e.g., updates to `loop_runtime_test_harness.py` or new unit tests) pass successfully.
        *   [ ] **No Unintended Scope Creep:** Verify the PR contains only the changes specified in the batch plan and does not introduce unrelated modifications.
        *   [ ] **Clear Commit Messages:** Ensure commit messages within the PR are descriptive and reference the relevant batch plan or task ID.
        *   [ ] **Review and Approve:** Only merge the PR after all checks are satisfactory.

This disciplined approach ensures that the Promethios kernel evolves in a controlled, auditable, and Codex-compliant manner.

## 3. Next Steps

Once the repository is initialized with these core files, Architect Manus will await your signal to proceed with generating the first batch plan for Phase 2.1, which will detail tasks for Builder Manus.
