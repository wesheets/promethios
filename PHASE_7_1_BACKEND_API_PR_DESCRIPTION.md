# Pull Request: Phase 7.1 Backend API Implementation

## Overview
This PR implements the backend API for Phase 7.1 of Promethios, providing the necessary endpoints to support the iPhone-inspired UI and investor-ready interface. This backend API is designed to be deployed as a separate service on Render, following the dual deployment architecture.

## Key Features
- **Authentication System**: Endpoints for user registration, login, and waitlist functionality
- **CMU Benchmark API**: Endpoints for metrics, comparison data, and parameter simulation
- **Feedback Collection**: Endpoints for gathering user feedback during beta testing
- **Health Check**: Monitoring endpoint for deployment verification

## Implementation Details
- Built with Express.js for robust API routing
- CORS enabled for secure cross-origin requests
- Environment variable configuration for flexible deployment
- Mock data implementation for immediate testing and demonstration

## Testing
- Local testing instructions included
- Health check endpoint for deployment verification
- Mock data designed to showcase the CMU benchmark visualization

## Deployment
- Designed for deployment on Render
- Environment variable configuration included
- Comprehensive deployment guide provided

## Related Documentation
- Dual deployment guide updated to include API setup
- Integration instructions for connecting UI and API services
- Environment variable configuration documentation

## Next Steps
- Database integration for persistent storage
- Authentication with JWT for secure access
- Analytics integration for user behavior tracking

This PR completes the backend API implementation for Phase 7.1, providing all necessary endpoints to support the investor-ready interface and CMU benchmark playground.
