- **Total Attestations metric** - "Digital certificates that verify the trustworthiness and credibility of agents"
- **Active Attestations metric** - "Attestations that are currently valid and not expired or revoked"
- **Average Confidence metric** - "Average confidence score across all trust attestations"
- **Enhanced user experience** - Clear explanations for all key metrics and features

#### **Features:**
- Trust attestation management with governance integration
- Credibility tracking and verification
- Confidence scoring and analytics
- Attestation lifecycle management
- User-scoped attestation data

## Integration Status

### **Routing Configuration ✅**
Both pages are properly routed in UIIntegration.tsx:
- **TrustBoundariesPage**: `/ui/trust/boundaries`
- **TrustAttestationsPage**: `/ui/trust/attestations`
- **ProtectedRoute wrappers** - Both pages require authentication
- **MainLayoutProxy integration** - Proper layout integration

### **Existing Governance Modules Usage ✅**
Both pages now properly use existing governance infrastructure:
- **trustBackendService** - Core trust evaluation and management
- **governanceDashboardBackendService** - Governance metrics and reporting
- **authApiService** - User authentication and API key management
- **Existing hooks** - useTrustBoundaries and useTrustAttestations already integrated with governance

### **Authentication Integration ✅**
- **Firebase Authentication** - Both pages use useAuth() context
- **User Validation** - Clear error messages for unauthenticated users
- **User-Scoped Data** - All operations filtered by current user
- **Session Management** - Proper handling of user sessions

## Key Improvements

### **1. Security & Authentication**
- **User Authentication Required** - Both pages now require login
- **User-Scoped Data Access** - Data filtered by authenticated user
- **Secure API Calls** - All backend calls use authenticated API service
- **Session Validation** - Proper user session management

### **2. User Experience**
- **Comprehensive Tooltips** - Clear explanations for all metrics and features
- **Authentication Feedback** - Clear messages when authentication required
- **Loading States** - Proper loading indicators during data fetch
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error messages and recovery

### **3. Governance Integration**
- **Existing Services** - Uses established governance backend services
- **Consistent Architecture** - Follows same patterns as other enhanced pages
- **Unified Authentication** - Same auth system as other governance pages
- **Integrated Metrics** - Trust metrics integrated with overall governance dashboard

### **4. Code Quality**
- **TypeScript Integration** - Proper type safety throughout
- **React Best Practices** - Modern hooks and component patterns
- **Error Boundaries** - Proper error handling and recovery
- **Performance Optimization** - Efficient data loading and state management

## System Architecture

### **Frontend Components**
1. **TrustBoundariesPage** - Enhanced with auth, tooltips, governance integration
2. **TrustAttestationsPage** - Enhanced with auth, tooltips, governance integration
3. **Existing Hooks** - useTrustBoundaries, useTrustAttestations (already governance-integrated)
4. **Authentication Context** - Firebase auth integration
5. **Governance Services** - Existing backend service integration

### **Backend Integration**
