# Trust Log Technical Debt Documentation

## Overview

This document details the technical debt identified in the trust_log components during the Phase 6.5 implementation. In accordance with the Promethios Codex principles, we are documenting all technical debt transparently to ensure it can be properly addressed in future work.

## Background

The trust_log components are peripheral to the main Phase 6.5 implementation of domain-specific governance profiles. During testing, we identified several issues related to React testing best practices and fetch mock implementations that need to be addressed.

## Issues

### 1. React State Updates Not Wrapped in act()

**Description:**  
The ReplayLogViewer component makes state updates that aren't properly wrapped in act() during testing, causing React warnings.

**Root Cause:**  
The component uses class-based React components with setState() calls that occur during asynchronous operations, which aren't properly handled in the test environment.

**Error Message:**
```
An update to ReplayLogViewer inside a test was not wrapped in act(...)
```

**File Locations:**
- `/trust_log/components_jsx/ReplayLogViewer.jsx` (line 47)
- `/trust_log/tests/TrustLogUI.test.jsx`

**Recommended Resolution:**
1. Refactor the ReplayLogViewer component to use React hooks instead of class components
2. Ensure all state updates in tests are wrapped in act()
3. Update the test file to properly handle asynchronous component lifecycle

**Priority:** Medium

### 2. Fetch Mock Implementation Issues

**Description:**  
The fetch mocks in the trust_log tests aren't properly applied in all contexts, causing "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'then')" errors.

**Root Cause:**  
The fetch mock implementation doesn't properly handle all code paths and API endpoints used by the components, particularly in nested promise chains.

**Error Message:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'then')
```

**File Locations:**
- `/trust_log/components_jsx/ReplayLogViewer.jsx` (line 50)
- `/trust_log/tests/TrustLogUI.test.jsx`

**Recommended Resolution:**
1. Implement a more robust fetch mock that handles all API endpoints
2. Ensure the mock is properly applied in all test contexts
3. Add proper error handling for fetch operations in the components

**Priority:** Medium

### 3. Mixed Module Systems

**Description:**  
The trust_log components use a mix of CommonJS (require) and ESModule (import) syntax, causing potential compatibility issues.

**Root Cause:**  
The components were originally written using CommonJS module system but were partially converted to use ESModules, resulting in inconsistent import/export patterns.

**File Locations:**
- All files in `/trust_log/components_jsx/`
- All files in `/trust_log/tests/`

**Recommended Resolution:**
1. Standardize on ESModule syntax throughout all trust_log components
2. Update all import/export statements to use consistent patterns
3. Ensure Jest and Babel configurations properly handle the chosen module system

**Priority:** Low

### 4. Schema Validation Issues

**Description:**  
The Ajv schema validation in trust_log components isn't properly mocked in tests, causing validation errors.

**Root Cause:**  
The components perform schema validation against external JSON schemas, but the tests don't properly mock these schemas or the validation process.

**File Locations:**
- `/trust_log/components_jsx/TrustSurfaceDisplay.jsx`
- `/trust_log/components_jsx/ReplayLogViewer.jsx`

**Recommended Resolution:**
1. Create proper mock schemas for testing
2. Implement a mock for the Ajv validation process
3. Add conditional validation that can be disabled in test environments

**Priority:** Low

## Action Items

The following tickets should be created to address these issues:

1. **PROM-6501**: Refactor ReplayLogViewer to use React hooks and fix act() warnings
2. **PROM-6502**: Implement robust fetch mocks for all trust_log API endpoints
3. **PROM-6503**: Standardize module system across all trust_log components
4. **PROM-6504**: Improve schema validation mocking in trust_log tests

## Timeline

These issues should be addressed in the next maintenance cycle after Phase 6.5 is completed. They do not block the current implementation of domain-specific governance profiles, which is the primary focus of Phase 6.5.

## Conclusion

By documenting these issues transparently and creating specific tickets for their resolution, we are complying with the Promethios Codex principle of acknowledging all technical debt. This approach allows us to proceed with the Phase 6.5 implementation while ensuring these issues will be properly addressed in future work.
