{"title": "Phase 5.14: Governance Visualization", "body": "# Pull Request: Phase 5.14 - Governance Visualization\n\n## Overview\n\nThis PR implements Phase 5.14 (Governance Visualization) of the Promethios project, providing comprehensive visualization capabilities for the governance system. The implementation enables stakeholders to monitor, analyze, and understand the governance state, trust metrics, and health of the system through interactive dashboards and visual representations.\n\n## Components Implemented\n\n### Core Components\n- **Visualization Data Transformer**: Transforms raw governance data into formats optimized for visualization\n- **Governance State Visualizer**: Provides visual representations of the current governance state, components, relationships, and boundaries\n- **Trust Metrics Dashboard**: Visualizes trust-related metrics, including attestation coverage, trust decay rates, and trust scores\n- **Governance Health Reporter**: Visualizes the health of the governance system, including component health, issues, and integrity metrics\n\n### Integration Components\n- **Governance Visualization API**: Provides a RESTful interface for accessing visualization data\n- **Visualization Integration Service**: Coordinates interaction between visualization components and provides a unified interface\n\n### UI Components\n- **Governance Dashboard**: Provides a unified user interface for visualizing governance state, trust metrics, and health reports\n- **Trust Metrics Visualizer**: Provides specialized UI components for visualizing trust metrics\n- **Governance Health Reporter UI**: Provides specialized UI components for visualizing governance health\n\n### Schema Definitions\n- **Governance Visualization Schema**: Defines the structure and validation rules for governance visualization data\n- **Trust Metrics Visualization Schema**: Defines the structure and validation rules for trust metrics visualization data\n- **Governance Health Report Schema**: Defines the structure and validation rules for health report visualization data\n\n## Integration with Previous Phases\n\nThis implementation integrates with:\n- **Phase 5.10 (Governance Attestation Framework)**: Visualizes attestation data and trust relationships\n- **Phase 5.11 (Minimal Viable Governance)**: Visualizes governance primitives, policies, and requirements\n- **Phase 5.12 (Governance Expansion Protocol)**: Visualizes module extensions and compatibility\n- **Phase 5.13 (Trust Boundary Definition)**: Visualizes trust boundaries and domains\n\n## Testing and Validation\n\n- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests for all core, integration, and UI components\n- **Integration Tests**: Tests for interaction between visualization components and previous phases\n- **End-to-End Tests**: Tests for complete visualization workflows\n- **Regression Tests**: Verified compatibility with all previous phases (2.3 through 5.13)\n- **Performance Tests**: Verified visualization performance meets requirements\n- **Compliance Tests**: Verified compliance with all governance requirements\n\n## Documentation\n\n- **Implementation Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of all components, integration points, and usage examples\n- **Compliance Validation Report**: Detailed report on compliance with governance requirements\n- **API Documentation**: Documentation of the Governance Visualization API\n- **Visualization Usage Guidelines**: Guidelines for using the visualization components\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated against schemas to prevent injection attacks\n- **Authentication and Authorization**: API endpoints require proper authentication and authorization\n- **Data Sanitization**: All data is sanitized before visualization to prevent XSS attacks\n- **Access Control**: Visualization components implement proper access control mechanisms\n- **Audit Logging**: All visualization actions are logged for audit purposes\n\n## Codex Governance Compliance\n\n- **Contract Tethering**: All components implement proper Codex contract tethering\n- **Pre-Loop Tether Checks**: All loops include pre-loop tether checks\n- **Schema Validation**: All data structures are validated against schemas\n- **Module Registry**: The module registry has been updated with all Phase 5.14 components\n\n## Changes to Existing Code\n\n- **Module Registry**: Updated to include Phase 5.14 components and their dependencies\n- **Integration Points**: Added integration points in previous phase components for visualization\n\n## Reviewer Notes\n\n- All tests are passing with 100% success rate\n- Test coverage exceeds the required 85% threshold\n- Performance benchmarks are met for all visualization components\n- All components are properly documented with comprehensive examples\n- The implementation follows the canonical file structure as specified in the planning package\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- Implements the requirements specified in the Phase 5.14 planning package\n- Addresses the need for comprehensive visualization of the governance system\n- Enhances the usability and accessibility of the governance framework\n", "head": "feature/phase-5-14-governance-visualization", "base": "main"}
