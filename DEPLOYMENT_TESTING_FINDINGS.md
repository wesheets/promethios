# Deployment Testing Findings

## üîç **Current Status: Deployment Infrastructure Gap Identified**

### ‚úÖ **What's Working:**
1. **Deployment UI**: Scorecard deployment buttons work correctly
2. **Persistence**: Deployed agents persist across logout/login sessions  
3. **Storage**: Unified storage system working with Firebase primary/localStorage fallback
4. **API Key Generation**: System generates API keys for deployed agents
5. **Deployment Records**: System creates and stores deployment records properly

### ‚ùå **Critical Gap: No Actual Agent Deployment Infrastructure**

#### **Issue 1: Blank Deployment URLs**
- **Problem**: "Test Agent" button redirects to blank page at `deployed-agent-deploy-1752546666141-gqhr7hnoc.promethios.ai`
- **Root Cause**: No actual agent service deployed at these URLs
- **Expected**: Should show a chat interface or API documentation for the deployed agent

#### **Issue 2: No User-Facing API Endpoints**
- **Problem**: API key `promethios_HSf4SIwCcRRzAFPuFXlFE9CsQ6W2_gghr7hnoc` has no endpoints to call
- **Tested Endpoints**: 
  - `/api/agents/chat` ‚Üí 404
  - `/api/deployed-agents` ‚Üí 404
  - `/api/` ‚Üí 404
- **Root Cause**: Current API only has endpoints for agents to report TO Promethios, not for users to interact WITH agents

#### **Issue 3: Missing Deployment Infrastructure**
- **Current**: System creates deployment records and URLs but doesn't actually deploy functional agents
- **Needed**: Actual agent deployment infrastructure that:
  1. Takes agent configurations and deploys them as accessible services
  2. Provides user-facing chat/API endpoints
  3. Reports governance data back to Promethios

## üéØ **What Should Be Implemented:**

### **1. Agent Deployment Service**
- Deploy agent configurations as actual running services
- Generate functional URLs that serve chat interfaces
- Handle user interactions and forward to appropriate LLM providers

### **2. User-Facing API Endpoints**
- `/api/agents/{agentId}/chat` - Chat with deployed agent
- `/api/agents/{agentId}/status` - Get agent status
- `/api/agents/{agentId}/docs` - API documentation

### **3. Governance Data Flow**
- Deployed agents should report metrics, violations, and activity back to Promethios
- This data should appear in the governance UI pages

## üìã **Testing Strategy Adjustment:**

Since actual agent deployment is not implemented, we should:
1. **Document the gap** (this document)
2. **Test the governance UI** with mock data to validate the data flow
3. **Recommend implementation approach** for actual agent deployment
4. **Focus testing on** the parts that are working (UI, persistence, storage)

## üöÄ **Next Steps:**
1. Test governance UI pages to see if they're functional
2. Create mock governance data to test the UI data flow
3. Recommend architecture for actual agent deployment infrastructure
