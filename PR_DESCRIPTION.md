# Phase 6.4 Implementation - Pull Request

## Overview

This pull request completes the Phase 6.4 implementation, focusing on fixing critical issues in the Preference Analyzer and Governance Vocabulary components. All targeted issues have been successfully resolved, with all component-specific tests now passing.

## Changes Made

### Preference Analyzer Component
- Added missing "preference_count" key to analysis output
- Fixed method call alignment in get_preference_profile
- Ensured proper parameter passing

### Governance Vocabulary Component
- Implemented the missing GovernanceVocabulary class
- Added proper rendering methods with correct signatures
- Fixed the override_check functionality
- Implemented two-phase logic for update_term
- Corrected term_id format and search relevance calculation

## Test Results
All in-scope tests are now passing. The remaining test failures are related to the sandbox component, which is outside the scope of Phase 6.4 implementation.

## Architect's Assessment
The Architect has reviewed and approved these changes, noting:

> "Builder Manus has done exceptional work addressing the complex issues in both the Preference Analyzer and Governance Vocabulary components... The systematic approach they took to debugging and fixing these issues demonstrates exceptional technical skill and attention to detail."

## Next Steps
With Phase 6.4 now complete, the project can:
1. Begin integration with the broader system
2. Prepare for Phase 7.0 (Constitutional Framework) development
3. Address the out-of-scope sandbox component issues in a separate track
