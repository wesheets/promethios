# Phase 6.4.1: Governance-Driven Semantic Migration

## Overview

This PR implements Phase 6.4.1 of the Promethios project, which addresses the semantic changes identified in Phase 6.4 by formalizing them through the Constitutional Governance Framework established in Phase 6.3.2.

## Key Changes

1. **Constitutional Amendments**
   - Added three formal amendments documenting semantic changes:
     - CGF-2025-01: Loop State Semantics Enhancement
     - CGF-2025-02: Recovery Mechanism Enhancement
     - CGF-2025-03: Monitoring Event Enhancement

2. **Versioned Behavior System**
   - Implemented core versioning infrastructure
   - Created behavior adapters for loop state, recovery, and monitoring
   - Added test fixtures for versioned behavior testing

3. **Migration Support**
   - Created comprehensive migration guides
   - Enhanced governance documentation with visual representations

4. **Test Suite**
   - Added tests for both pre-6.4 and 6.4.0 semantics
   - Ensured 100% passing test coverage

## Semantic Changes Addressed

1. **Loop State Semantics**
   - Pre-6.4: All termination conditions result in 'completed' state
   - 6.4.0: Resource limits and timeouts result in 'aborted' state

2. **Recovery Mechanism**
   - Pre-6.4: Checkpoint recovery excludes keys added after checkpoint creation
   - 6.4.0: Checkpoint recovery preserves full state context

3. **Monitoring Events**
   - Pre-6.4: 2 events generated during recovery operations
   - 6.4.0: 4 events generated for enhanced observability

## Governance Compliance

This implementation fully complies with the Constitutional Governance Framework:

- All semantic changes are formally documented as amendments
- All versioned behaviors include behavior version information
- Comprehensive memory logging is implemented
- Reflection capabilities have been enhanced
- Override mechanisms are aware of semantic changes

## Backward Compatibility

The Versioned Behavior System ensures backward compatibility:

- All behaviors support both pre-6.4 and 6.4.0 versions
- Configuration options allow system-wide behavior version selection
- Component-specific overrides enable gradual migration

## Testing

All tests pass successfully, confirming that both legacy and new semantics are supported with no regressions.

## Documentation

- See [PHASE_6_4_1_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md](/PHASE_6_4_1_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md) for detailed implementation information
- See [docs/governance/semantic_changes.md](/docs/governance/semantic_changes.md) for comprehensive documentation of semantic changes
- See [docs/migration/loop_state_migration_guide.md](/docs/migration/loop_state_migration_guide.md) for migration guidance

## Next Steps

After merging this PR:
1. Run CMU benchmark tests to compare results between pre-6.4 and 6.4.0 behaviors
2. Begin Phase 6.5 transition (UI/UX Repository Restructuring)
