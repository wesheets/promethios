# Final Constructor Error Fix - "be is not a constructor"

## 🎯 **Root Cause Identified:**
The enhanced debugging revealed the exact issue: `TypeError: be is not a constructor at onClick (index-BL-6DwMo.js:3767:832761)`

The error was occurring because:
- The minified variable "be" represents `EnhancedDeploymentService` in the build
- Direct class name reference in `new EnhancedDeploymentService()` was causing minification issues
- The constructor call was failing in the production build

## 🔧 **Fix Applied:**
**File:** `/phase_7_1_prototype/promethios-ui/src/modules/agent-wrapping/services/EnhancedDeploymentService.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
_enhancedDeploymentServiceInstance = new EnhancedDeploymentService();
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Create instance using explicit class reference to avoid minification issues
const ServiceClass = EnhancedDeploymentService;
_enhancedDeploymentServiceInstance = new ServiceClass();
```

## ✅ **Expected Results:**
- ❌ No more "be is not a constructor" errors
- ✅ Proper service initialization in production builds
- ✅ Deploy Agent button should work correctly
- ✅ Clean console logs without constructor errors

## 🚀 **Technical Details:**
This fix addresses minification issues where direct class name references in constructor calls can be problematic. By assigning the class to a variable first, we ensure the constructor call works correctly in both development and production builds.

## 📋 **Next Steps:**
1. Deploy updated code to Render
2. Test Deploy Agent button functionality
3. Verify clean console logs
4. Confirm successful agent deployment

This should be the final fix needed to resolve the deployment constructor error!
