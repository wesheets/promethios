# Feature Integration and Route Compatibility Validation

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the validation process and results for feature integration and route compatibility across all Promethios UI modules. The goal is to ensure that all components work seamlessly together, navigation flows correctly, and extension points function as designed.

## 2. Validation Methodology

The validation process follows these key steps:

1. **Route Mapping Verification**: Confirm that all routes defined in the UI Route Mapping document are properly implemented and accessible.
2. **Navigation Flow Testing**: Validate that navigation between routes works correctly, including breadcrumb trails and state preservation.
3. **Extension Point Integration**: Verify that all extension points are properly registered and can be utilized by modules.
4. **Permission-Based Access**: Test that routes and features respect user roles and permissions.
5. **Cross-Module Data Flow**: Validate data sharing and communication between different modules.
6. **Edge Case Handling**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios.
