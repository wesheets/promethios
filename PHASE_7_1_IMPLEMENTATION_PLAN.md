Phase 7.1 "iPhone-Inspired Onboarding & Investor-Ready Interface" will transform Promethios from a powerful technical framework into an accessible, visually compelling product ready for both developer adoption and investor presentations. By focusing on UX design principles inspired by the iPhone's intuitive approach, we'll create an experience that makes Promethios's complex governance capabilities approachable and immediately valuable to all stakeholders.

The addition of the CMU Benchmark Platform provides a powerful tool for demonstrating Promethios's effectiveness through concrete, interactive data. This gives investors the ability to directly explore and validate the system's impact, transforming abstract governance concepts into tangible, measurable outcomes.

This phase is critical for demonstrating Promethios's market readiness and will provide the foundation for user growth and investor engagement in subsequent phases.
