My initial instinct is to think about market research and financial projections, but I'm realizing that might be because those are the most concrete, measurable factors. Let me step back and consider the broader picture: What's driving your interest in this expansion? What are your company's core strengths that might translate to the new market? I'm also noticing I don't know crucial details about your specific business, industry, or current market position, which makes me hesitant to give specific advice. Instead, let me suggest a framework we could work through together: 1) Market opportunity assessment (size, competition, barriers to entry), 2) Internal capability evaluation (do you have the resources and expertise?), 3) Strategic fit analysis (does this align with your long-term vision?), 4) Risk assessment (what could go wrong and how would you handle it?).

Let me work through this methodically with you: I'm looking at treatment recommendations and outcomes across different demographic groups, geographic areas, insurance types, and presenting conditions.
