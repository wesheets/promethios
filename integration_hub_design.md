# Integration Hub for External Systems Design

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design for the Integration Hub in the Promethios platform. The Integration Hub will serve as a centralized module for connecting Promethios with various external systems, including CI/CD pipelines, monitoring tools, other AI governance frameworks, and enterprise applications. This will enable seamless data exchange, automated workflows, and a more holistic view of AI governance across the organization.

## 2. Core Objectives

- **Interoperability**: Enable Promethios to send and receive data from diverse external systems.
- **Automation**: Facilitate automated governance processes triggered by external events (e.g., model deployment, security alerts).
- **Extensibility**: Provide a framework for developers to build custom connectors for new systems.
- **Centralized Management**: Offer a unified interface for configuring and monitoring integrations.
- **Security**: Ensure secure communication and data handling with external systems.

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Core Components

1.  **IntegrationHubService**: The main backend service responsible for managing integration lifecycles, data transformation, and communication with external systems.
2.  **ConnectorRegistry**: Manages available connectors (both built-in and custom).
3.  **ConnectorInstanceService**: Manages configured instances of connectors, including their credentials and settings.
4.  **EventBus**: An internal event bus for decoupling producers and consumers of integration events within Promethios.
5.  **WebhookService**: Manages incoming webhooks from external systems.
6.  **APIGateway (for external access)**: Securely exposes Promethios APIs for external systems to interact with.

### 3.2 Data Flow

-   **Inbound**: External System -> Connector (Adapter) -> IntegrationHubService -> Promethios Modules (e.g., Governance, Trust Metrics, Agent Scorecard).
-   **Outbound**: Promethios Modules -> IntegrationHubService -> Connector (Adapter) -> External System.

```typescript
// High-level service interfaces

interface IntegrationHubService {
  initialize(): Promise<void>;
  processInboundData(connectorId: string, instanceId: string, data: any): Promise<void>;
  triggerOutboundData(connectorId: string, instanceId: string, eventType: string, payload: any): Promise<void>;
  getIntegrationStatus(instanceId: string): Promise<IntegrationStatus>;
}

interface Connector {
  id: string; // e.g., "gitlab-ci", "prometheus-monitoring"
  name: string;
  description: string;
  type: "ci_cd" | "monitoring" | "governance_framework" | "custom";
  configSchema: Record<string, any>; // JSON schema for configuration
  handleInbound(config: Record<string, any>, data: any): Promise<ProcessedData>; // Transforms external data to Promethios format
  handleOutbound(config: Record<string, any>, promethiosEvent: PromethiosEvent): Promise<ExternalPayload>; // Transforms Promethios event to external format
}

interface ConnectorInstance {
  id: string;
  connectorId: string;
  name: string;
  config: Record<string, any>; // Instance-specific configuration (credentials, endpoints)
  isEnabled: boolean;
  lastStatus: IntegrationStatus;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface IntegrationStatus {
  status: "healthy" | "degraded" | "error" | "disabled";
  lastSync?: Date;
  lastError?: string;
}
```

## 4. Supported Integrations (Examples)

### 4.1 CI/CD Pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions)
-   **Triggers**: Model deployment, code commit, test completion.
-   **Actions**: Initiate governance checks, update model registry, log deployment events in Promethios.
-   **Data Exchange**: Deployment metadata, test results, governance compliance status.

### 4.2 Monitoring Tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog)
-   **Triggers**: Performance metric thresholds, anomaly detection.
-   **Actions**: Create alerts in Promethios, update trust scores, trigger re-evaluation of models.
-   **Data Exchange**: Model performance metrics, operational logs, alert data.

### 4.3 Other AI Governance Frameworks
-   **Triggers**: Policy updates, audit log generation.
-   **Actions**: Synchronize policies, share audit logs, federate governance insights.
-   **Data Exchange**: Policy definitions, audit records, compliance reports.

### 4.4 Enterprise Applications (e.g., JIRA, Slack)
-   **Triggers**: Governance violations, new agent registration, benchmark completion.
-   **Actions**: Create JIRA tickets for remediation, send Slack notifications.
-   **Data Exchange**: Alert details, task assignments, status updates.

## 5. Key Features

### 5.1 Connector Framework
-   Standardized interface for developing connectors.
-   SDK for common tasks (authentication, data mapping).
-   Support for polling, webhooks, and direct API calls.

### 5.2 Data Mapping and Transformation
-   UI-driven or code-based data mapping capabilities.
-   Support for common data formats (JSON, XML, CSV) and transformation languages (e.g., JMESPath, JSONata).

### 5.3 Authentication and Security
-   Secure credential management (e.g., using HashiCorp Vault or similar, integrated with Firebase for user-level secrets if applicable).
-   Support for OAuth 2.0, API keys, and other common authentication mechanisms.
-   Data encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest.

### 5.4 Logging and Monitoring
-   Detailed logging of all integration activities.
-   Dashboard for monitoring the health and status of active integrations.
-   Alerting for integration failures.

### 5.5 Webhook Management
-   Secure endpoint for receiving webhooks from external systems.
-   Request validation and signature verification.

## 6. UI Components

### 6.1 Integration Hub Dashboard (Route: `/settings/integrations`)
-   Overview of all configured integrations and their status.
-   Ability to add new integrations from the `ConnectorRegistry`.
-   Links to configure, enable/disable, or delete existing integrations.

### 6.2 Connector Configuration Page
-   Dynamically generated form based on the `configSchema` of the selected connector.
-   Fields for credentials, endpoints, data mapping rules, and sync frequency.
-   Test connection functionality.

### 6.3 Integration Logs Viewer
-   Displays detailed logs for a specific integration instance.
-   Filtering and searching capabilities.

## 7. Firebase Integration

-   **Firestore**: Store `ConnectorInstance` configurations, integration logs, and potentially user-specific integration settings.
    -   `integrationConnectors/{connectorId}`: Stores definitions of available connectors (can be pre-populated or dynamically registered).
    -   `integrationInstances/{instanceId}`: Stores user-configured instances of connectors, including their encrypted credentials (or references to a secure vault) and settings.
    -   `integrationLogs/{instanceId}/logs/{logId}`: Stores execution logs for each instance.
-   **Firebase Authentication**: User roles can determine who can configure or manage integrations.
-   **Firebase Functions**: Could be used to host webhook endpoints or perform asynchronous processing for integrations.
-   **Security Rules**: Ensure that users can only access/manage integrations they are authorized for.
    ```firestore.rules
    match /integrationInstances/{instanceId} {
      // Example: Allow users with 'admin' role to manage all instances
      // Or, store ownerId on the instance and allow owner to manage
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.roles.includes('admin');
    }
    match /integrationLogs/{instanceId}/logs/{logId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.roles.includes('admin'); // Or owner-based
    }
    ```

## 8. Navigation Integration

-   **Left Navigation**: A new top-level item "Integrations" or under "Settings" -> "Integrations" will link to the Integration Hub Dashboard (`/settings/integrations`).
-   **Header Navigation (Planned)**: Could include a quick status indicator for integrations or direct links to frequently used integration actions if applicable.
-   The Integration Hub UI will adhere to the **full-width layout** principles, with collapsible navigation elements to maximize content visibility.

## 9. Mobile Responsiveness and Accessibility

-   All UI components of the Integration Hub (Dashboard, Configuration Pages, Logs Viewer) will be designed following the established **Mobile Responsiveness Guidelines** and **Accessibility Guidelines**.
-   This includes fluid layouts, appropriate breakpoints, touch-friendly controls, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and sufficient color contrast.

## 10. API Design (External Facing)

Promethios may expose a limited, secure API for certain external systems to push data or trigger actions if direct connector-based integration is not feasible.

-   `POST /api/v1/integrations/webhooks/{connectorInstanceId}`: Generic webhook receiver.
-   `GET /api/v1/governance/status?modelId={modelId}`: Example API for an external system to query governance status.

## 11. Extension Points

```typescript
// Register a custom connector
ExtensionRegistry.registerExtensionPoint("integration:connector", {
  register: (connector: Connector) => ConnectorRegistry.registerConnector(connector),
});

// Register a custom data transformer
ExtensionRegistry.registerExtensionPoint("integration:transformer", {
  register: (transformer: DataTransformer) => DataTransformerRegistry.registerTransformer(transformer),
});
```
