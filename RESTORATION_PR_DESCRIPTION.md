# Restoration PR Description

## Overview
This PR restores 25 backed-up files from the Phase 6.3.1 implementation and fixes four legacy tests that were failing due to import path changes. The restoration ensures that no work is lost while maintaining compatibility with the updated repository structure.

## Components Restored
1. Schema files (9 files) - JSON schema definitions for various components
2. Source code files (10 files) - API endpoints, testing frameworks, and simulators
3. Test files (3 files) - Unit tests for the test harness
4. UI files (2 files) - CSS and HTML template files
5. Configuration file (1 file) - src/config.py

## Compatibility Layers Added
1. **Compliance Mapping Framework** - Backward compatibility for the compliance framework classes
2. **Schema Validation Registry** - Compatibility layer for schema validation components
3. **API Schema Validation** - Module path compatibility for API schema validation
4. **TheAgentCompany Integration** - Compatibility for benchmark integration tests

## Tests Fixed
1. `test_compliance_framework.py` - Updated to use compatibility layer
2. `test_schema_registry.py` - Fixed import paths
3. `test_memory_routes.py` - Resolved module structure and import issues
4. `test_theagentcompany_integration.py` - Added compatibility for benchmark types

## Implementation Approach
- All original files were restored to their exact original locations
- Compatibility layers were added to bridge old and new import paths
- Module structure was adjusted to ensure proper resolution of imports
- All tests now pass with only deprecation warnings (as expected)

## Future Recommendations
1. Update legacy code to use the new canonical import paths
2. Gradually phase out compatibility layers as code is updated
3. Add integration tests to verify cross-module functionality
