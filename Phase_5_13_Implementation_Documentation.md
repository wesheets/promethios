# Phase 5.13: Trust Boundary Definition - Implementation Documentation

## Overview

The Trust Boundary Definition framework (Phase 5.13) enables Promethios to define, manage, and verify trust boundaries within the system, ensuring that trust guarantees are maintained across different domains and that boundary crossings are properly controlled and verified. This phase builds directly on the Governance Expansion Protocol from Phase 5.12 and integrates with all previous phases.

This document provides comprehensive documentation of the implementation of Phase 5.13, including architecture, components, workflows, integration points, and compliance considerations.

## Architecture

The Trust Boundary Definition framework is built on a layered architecture:

1. **Schema Layer**: JSON schemas that define the structure and validation rules for trust boundaries, boundary crossings, boundary integrity verifications, and trust domains.

2. **Core Layer**: Core components that implement the business logic for boundary detection, crossing protocols, integrity verification, and trust domain management.

3. **Integration Layer**: Integration points with other Promethios components, particularly the governance framework, attestation services, and module extension system.

4. **Visualization Layer**: UI components for visualizing and managing trust boundaries and domains.

## Core Components

### Boundary Detection Engine

The Boundary Detection Engine is responsible for detecting, registering, and managing trust boundaries within the system. It provides capabilities for:

- Registering new boundaries with proper schema validation and contract tethering
- Updating existing boundaries while maintaining integrity
- Adding entry and exit points to boundaries
- Adding controls to boundaries for security and governance
- Querying and listing boundaries based on various criteria

The Boundary Detection Engine integrates with the Seal Verification Service to ensure that all boundaries are properly sealed and that their integrity can be verified.

```python
class BoundaryDetectionEngine:
    def __init__(self, schema_validator, seal_verification_service, boundaries_file_path=None):
        """Initialize the Boundary Detection Engine."""
        self.schema_validator = schema_validator
        self.seal_verification_service = seal_verification_service
        self.boundaries_file_path = boundaries_file_path or "/tmp/boundaries.json"
        self.boundaries = self._load_boundaries()

    def register_boundary(self, boundary_def):
        """Register a new boundary."""
        # Validate the boundary definition against the schema
        self._validate_boundary_definition(boundary_def)
        
        # Create a seal for the boundary
        boundary_def["seal"] = self.seal_verification_service.create_seal(boundary_def)
        
        # Add the boundary to the registry
        self.boundaries[boundary_def["boundary_id"]] = boundary_def
        
        # Save the updated boundaries
        self._save_boundaries()
        
        return boundary_def["boundary_id"]

    # Additional methods for boundary management...
```

### Boundary Crossing Protocol

The Boundary Crossing Protocol manages the interactions between different trust boundaries. It provides capabilities for:

- Registering boundary crossings with proper validation and contract tethering
- Validating crossings against security and governance requirements
- Adding controls to crossings for security and governance
- Monitoring and auditing boundary crossings

The Boundary Crossing Protocol ensures that all interactions between boundaries are properly controlled, validated, and audited.

```python
class BoundaryCrossingProtocol:
    def __init__(self, boundary_detection_engine, schema_validator, seal_verification_service, crossings_file_path=None):
        """Initialize the Boundary Crossing Protocol."""
        self.boundary_detection_engine = boundary_detection_engine
        self.schema_validator = schema_validator
        self.seal_verification_service = seal_verification_service
        self.crossings_file_path = crossings_file_path or "/tmp/crossings.json"
        self.crossings = self._load_crossings()

    def register_crossing(self, crossing_def):
        """Register a new boundary crossing."""
        # Validate the crossing definition against the schema
        self._validate_crossing_definition(crossing_def)
        
        # Verify that the source and target boundaries exist
        self._verify_boundaries_exist(crossing_def["source_boundary_id"], crossing_def["target_boundary_id"])
        
        # Create a seal for the crossing
        crossing_def["seal"] = self.seal_verification_service.create_seal(crossing_def)
        
        # Add the crossing to the registry
        self.crossings[crossing_def["crossing_id"]] = crossing_def
        
        # Save the updated crossings
        self._save_crossings()
        
        return crossing_def["crossing_id"]

    # Additional methods for crossing management...
```

### Boundary Integrity Verifier

The Boundary Integrity Verifier ensures that trust boundaries maintain their integrity over time. It provides capabilities for:

- Verifying the integrity of boundaries and their crossings
- Detecting mutations and violations of boundaries
- Reporting and remediating boundary violations
- Providing recommendations for improving boundary integrity

The Boundary Integrity Verifier integrates with the Mutation Detector and Attestation Service to provide comprehensive integrity verification.

```python
class BoundaryIntegrityVerifier:
    def __init__(self, boundary_detection_engine, boundary_crossing_protocol, seal_verification_service, mutation_detector, attestation_service, schema_validator, verifications_file_path=None):
        """Initialize the Boundary Integrity Verifier."""
        self.boundary_detection_engine = boundary_detection_engine
        self.boundary_crossing_protocol = boundary_crossing_protocol
        self.seal_verification_service = seal_verification_service
        self.mutation_detector = mutation_detector
        self.attestation_service = attestation_service
        self.schema_validator = schema_validator
        self.verifications_file_path = verifications_file_path or "/tmp/verifications.json"
        self.verifications = self._load_verifications()

    def verify_boundary_integrity(self, boundary_id, verification_type="standard"):
        """Verify the integrity of a boundary."""
        # Get the boundary
        boundary = self.boundary_detection_engine.get_boundary(boundary_id)
        
        # Verify the boundary's seal
        seal_valid = self.seal_verification_service.verify_seal(boundary)
        
        # Verify the boundary's contract tether
        tether_valid = self.seal_verification_service.verify_contract_tether(boundary)
        
        # Initialize the verification result
        verification = {
            "verification_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
            "boundary_id": boundary_id,
            "verification_type": verification_type,
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "result": {
                "integrity_status": "intact",
                "seal_valid": seal_valid,
                "tether_valid": tether_valid
            }
        }
        
        # Perform additional verification based on the verification type
        if verification_type == "mutation_detection":
            self._perform_mutation_detection(verification, boundary)
        elif verification_type == "attestation_verification":
            self._perform_attestation_verification(verification, boundary)
        
        # Create a seal for the verification
        verification["seal"] = self.seal_verification_service.create_seal(verification)
        
        # Add the verification to the registry
        self.verifications[verification["verification_id"]] = verification
        
        # Save the updated verifications
        self._save_verifications()
        
        return verification

    # Additional methods for integrity verification...
```

### Trust Domain Manager

The Trust Domain Manager manages trust domains, which are logical groupings of components that share common trust characteristics. It provides capabilities for:

- Registering and managing trust domains
- Associating domains with boundaries
- Managing relationships between domains
- Calculating trust levels for domains
- Managing domain evolution through merging and splitting

The Trust Domain Manager integrates with the Governance Primitive Manager and Attestation Service to provide comprehensive trust management.

```python
class TrustDomainManager:
    def __init__(self, boundary_detection_engine, governance_primitive_manager, attestation_service, evolution_protocol, schema_validator, seal_verification_service, domains_file_path=None):
        """Initialize the Trust Domain Manager."""
        self.boundary_detection_engine = boundary_detection_engine
        self.governance_primitive_manager = governance_primitive_manager
        self.attestation_service = attestation_service
        self.evolution_protocol = evolution_protocol
        self.schema_validator = schema_validator
        self.seal_verification_service = seal_verification_service
        self.domains_file_path = domains_file_path or "/tmp/domains.json"
        self.domains = self._load_domains()

    def register_domain(self, domain_def):
        """Register a new trust domain."""
        # Validate the domain definition against the schema
        self._validate_domain_definition(domain_def)
        
        # Create a seal for the domain
        domain_def["seal"] = self.seal_verification_service.create_seal(domain_def)
        
        # Add the domain to the registry
        self.domains[domain_def["domain_id"]] = domain_def
        
        # Save the updated domains
        self._save_domains()
        
        return domain_def["domain_id"]

    # Additional methods for domain management...
```

### Trust Domain Schema

The Trust Domain Schema defines the structure and validation rules for trust domains. It includes:

- Domain identification and metadata
- Domain type and classification
- Components within the domain
- Boundaries associated with the domain
- Relationships with other domains
- Governance policies and attestations

## Integration Points

### Integration with Governance Framework

The Trust Boundary Definition framework integrates with the Governance Framework (Phases 5.10 and 5.11) to ensure that trust boundaries and domains are governed according to established policies and requirements. Key integration points include:

1. **Attestation Service Integration**: The Boundary Integrity Verifier integrates with the Attestation Service to verify attestations for boundaries and to create new attestations for boundary integrity verifications.

2. **Governance Primitive Manager Integration**: The Trust Domain Manager integrates with the Governance Primitive Manager to associate governance policies with trust domains and to validate policy compliance.

3. **Audit Trail Integration**: All boundary and domain operations are recorded in the Governance Audit Trail to provide a comprehensive audit history.

### Integration with Module Extension System

The Trust Boundary Definition framework integrates with the Module Extension System (Phase 5.12) to support extensibility and customization. Key integration points include:

1. **Boundary Type Extensions**: The Boundary Detection Engine supports custom boundary types through extensions registered with the Module Extension Registry.

2. **Crossing Type Extensions**: The Boundary Crossing Protocol supports custom crossing types through extensions registered with the Module Extension Registry.

3. **Trust Calculation Extensions**: The Trust Domain Manager supports custom trust calculation methods through extensions registered with the Module Extension Registry.

### Integration with Trust Decay Engine

The Trust Boundary Definition framework integrates with the Trust Decay Engine (Phase 5.9) to model trust decay over time. Key integration points include:

1. **Trust Level Calculation**: The Trust Domain Manager calculates trust levels for domains based on various factors, including trust decay over time.

2. **Trust Decay Modeling**: The Trust Domain Manager models trust decay for domain relationships based on time, events, and other factors.

## Workflows

### Boundary Definition and Management Workflow

1. **Boundary Registration**: A new boundary is registered with the Boundary Detection Engine, including its type, classification, and other metadata.

2. **Entry and Exit Point Definition**: Entry and exit points are added to the boundary to define how data and control flow in and out of the boundary.

3. **Control Addition**: Controls are added to the boundary to enforce security and governance requirements.

4. **Boundary Verification**: The Boundary Integrity Verifier verifies the integrity of the boundary to ensure it has not been compromised.

5. **Boundary Update**: The boundary is updated as needed to reflect changes in the system or requirements.

### Boundary Crossing Workflow

1. **Crossing Registration**: A new boundary crossing is registered with the Boundary Crossing Protocol, including its source and target boundaries, type, direction, and other metadata.

2. **Control Addition**: Controls are added to the crossing to enforce security and governance requirements.

3. **Crossing Validation**: The Boundary Crossing Protocol validates the crossing to ensure it complies with security and governance requirements.

4. **Crossing Monitoring**: The Boundary Crossing Protocol monitors the crossing to detect and report violations.

### Trust Domain Management Workflow

1. **Domain Registration**: A new trust domain is registered with the Trust Domain Manager, including its type, classification, owner, and other metadata.

2. **Component Addition**: Components are added to the domain to define what is included in the domain.

3. **Boundary Association**: The domain is associated with one or more boundaries to define its trust perimeter.

4. **Relationship Definition**: Relationships with other domains are defined to model trust between domains.

5. **Policy Association**: Governance policies are associated with the domain to enforce governance requirements.

6. **Trust Level Calculation**: The Trust Domain Manager calculates the trust level for the domain based on various factors.

7. **Domain Evolution**: The domain evolves over time through merging, splitting, and other operations.

## Compliance and Governance

### Contract Tethering

All components of the Trust Boundary Definition framework implement proper Codex contract tethering to ensure their integrity and authenticity. This includes:

- Creating cryptographic seals for all boundary, crossing, verification, and domain definitions
- Verifying seals when retrieving or using these definitions
- Verifying contract tethers to ensure the definitions have not been tampered with

### Schema Validation

All data structures in the Trust Boundary Definition framework are validated against their respective schemas to ensure data integrity and compliance. This includes:

- Validating boundary definitions against the Trust Boundary Schema
- Validating crossing definitions against the Boundary Crossing Schema
- Validating verification definitions against the Boundary Integrity Schema
- Validating domain definitions against the Trust Domain Schema

### Governance Integration

The Trust Boundary Definition framework integrates with the governance framework to ensure that trust boundaries and domains are governed according to established policies and requirements. This includes:

- Integrating with the Attestation Service for attestation verification
- Integrating with the Governance Primitive Manager for policy management
- Recording all operations in the Governance Audit Trail

### Module Extension Support

The Trust Boundary Definition framework supports extensibility through the module extension framework to allow for customization and evolution. This includes:

- Supporting custom boundary types through extensions
- Supporting custom crossing types through extensions
- Supporting custom trust calculation methods through extensions

### Compatibility Verification

The Trust Boundary Definition framework verifies compatibility between boundaries to ensure that trust guarantees are maintained across boundary crossings. This includes:

- Verifying compatibility between source and target boundaries
- Verifying integrity of boundaries and their crossings
- Detecting and reporting violations of trust guarantees

## Testing and Validation

The Trust Boundary Definition framework has been thoroughly tested and validated to ensure its correctness, performance, and compliance. This includes:

### Unit Tests

Comprehensive unit tests have been developed for all components of the framework, including:

- Boundary Detection Engine tests
- Boundary Crossing Protocol tests
- Boundary Integrity Verifier tests
- Trust Domain Manager tests
- Sample Boundary Definitions tests

### Integration Tests

Integration tests have been developed to validate the interactions between different components of the framework, including:

- Boundary Detection Engine and Boundary Crossing Protocol integration

## Conclusion

The Trust Boundary Definition framework (Phase 5.13) provides a comprehensive solution for defining, managing, and verifying trust boundaries within the Promethios system. It ensures that trust guarantees are maintained across different domains and that boundary crossings are properly controlled and verified.

The framework integrates with previous phases, particularly the Governance Expansion Protocol (Phase 5.12), to provide a complete governance solution for Promethios. It supports extensibility through the module extension framework and ensures compliance with governance requirements through proper contract tethering, schema validation, and governance integration.

The framework has been thoroughly tested and validated to ensure its correctness, performance, and compliance. It is ready for integration into the Promethios project and will provide a solid foundation for future phases.
