# Agent Toolset Auto-Discovery & Governance Integration

## Overview
Comprehensive system for automatically detecting agent capabilities and applying appropriate governance based on tool risk profiles.

## Implementation Status
- âœ… **Tool Catalog**: Defined comprehensive tool categories with risk levels
- âœ… **Auto-Discovery Service**: API introspection and runtime analysis
- âœ… **Governance Rules**: Risk-based policies per tool category
- ðŸ”„ **Integration Pending**: Needs integration with agent registration and governance monitoring

## Key Components

### 1. Tool Categories & Risk Levels
```typescript
// Safe Tools (Risk 1-3): text_generation, math_calculation, data_analysis
// Moderate Risk (Risk 4-6): web_search, image_generation, email_send  
// High Risk (Risk 7-8): file_system, browser_automation, shell_execution
// Restricted (Risk 9-10): database_access, network_access
```

### 2. Auto-Discovery Methods
- **API Introspection** (90% confidence): Parse OpenAPI/Swagger specs
- **Response Parsing** (70% confidence): Detect tools from agent responses  
- **Runtime Monitoring** (95% confidence): Track actual tool invocations
- **Manual Override** (100% confidence): User can add/remove tools

### 3. Governance Integration Points

#### Agent Registration Flow
- [ ] Add toolset detection during agent wrapping
- [ ] Display detected tools with risk indicators
- [ ] Allow manual tool override/addition
- [ ] Calculate overall agent risk score

#### Agent Scorecards  
- [ ] Show tool inventory with risk levels
- [ ] Display usage statistics and patterns
- [ ] Governance compliance per tool category
- [ ] Tool-specific recommendations

#### Runtime Governance
- [ ] Monitor tool usage in real-time
- [ ] Flag violations based on tool policies
- [ ] Track tool usage in audit trail
- [ ] Update risk scores dynamically

#### Observer Integration
- [ ] Tool-specific governance alerts
- [ ] Risk-based monitoring thresholds
- [ ] Tool usage pattern analysis
- [ ] Compliance reporting per tool

## Future Foundry Integration

### Tool Marketplace
- Visual tool browser with categories
- Drag & drop tool assignment to agents
- Tool compatibility checking
- Community tool sharing

### Custom Tool Creation
- Visual tool builder interface
- API endpoint configuration
- Risk level assignment
- Governance rule definition

### Permission Management
- Fine-grained tool access control
- Environment-based restrictions
- User role-based tool access
- Approval workflows for high-risk tools

## Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Basic tool detection during agent registration
2. **Phase 2**: Runtime monitoring and governance integration  
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced analytics and recommendations
4. **Phase 4**: Foundry marketplace and custom tools

## Files Created
- `AgentToolsetService.ts`: Tool catalog and governance rules
- `AgentToolDiscovery.ts`: Auto-discovery and analysis system

## Next Steps
1. Complete chat functionality first (governance toggles, real metrics, smart observer)
2. Integrate toolset detection into agent registration flow
3. Add tool display to agent scorecards
4. Implement runtime tool monitoring in governance system

*This system will provide enterprise-grade tool governance while maintaining user-friendly auto-discovery capabilities.*
