# Promethios Phase 6.5 & 6.5.1 PR Description

## Overview

This PR implements Phase 6.5 and 6.5.1 of the Promethios project. Phase 6.5 introduces domain-specific governance profiles that optimize agent behaviors across different professional contexts, while Phase 6.5.1 resolves all technical debt in the trust_log components as required by the Promethios Codex principles.

## Key Features

### Phase 6.5: Domain-Specific Governance Profiles
- **Domain-Specific Governance Profiles**: Customized governance parameters for Software Engineering, Product Management, Human Resources, and Administrative domains
- **Profile Selection UI**: Components for selecting and comparing governance profiles
- **Metrics Visualization**: Visual representation of governance metrics across domains
- **Backend API Integration**: Full integration with the governance backend
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and API tests for all components

### Phase 6.5.1: Technical Debt Resolution
- **React Component Refactoring**: Converted class components to functional components with hooks
- **Improved Async Handling**: Enhanced error handling and state management for async operations
- **Robust Test Mocking**: Implemented comprehensive fetch and schema validation mocks
- **Module System Standardization**: Ensured consistent use of ESModule syntax

## Implementation Details

### Phase 6.5
1. Core types and interfaces for governance profiles
2. Context provider with API integration
3. Domain-specific UI components
4. Profile selection and metrics visualization
5. Comprehensive testing infrastructure
6. Technical documentation and user guides

### Phase 6.5.1
1. Refactored ReplayLogViewer to use React hooks
2. Implemented robust fetch mocks for all API endpoints
3. Enhanced schema validation with Ajv
4. Improved error handling for all async operations
5. Added proper cleanup to prevent state updates after unmount

## Benchmark Results Integration

This implementation directly addresses the variations observed in our benchmark testing:

- **Software Engineering**: Optimized for trust maintenance despite quality trade-offs
- **Product Management**: Optimized for performance with minimal trust impact
- **Human Resources**: Prioritizes trust improvement over raw performance
- **Administrative**: Balanced optimization for both performance and trust

## Testing

All components have been thoroughly tested:

- Unit tests for core components
- Integration tests for domain-specific components
- API integration tests for backend communication
- All trust_log tests now pass successfully

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is included:

- Technical documentation in `/docs/governance/domain_specific_profiles.md`
- User guide in `/docs/governance/domain_specific_profiles_user_guide.md`
- Implementation report in `/PHASE_6_5_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`
- Technical debt resolution report in `/PHASE_6_5_1_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`
- Resolved technical debt documentation in `/RESOLVED_TRUST_LOG_TECHNICAL_DEBT.md`

## Promethios Codex Compliance

This PR fully complies with the Promethios Codex principles by:
1. Implementing domain-specific governance profiles to optimize agent behaviors
2. Resolving all technical debt before moving forward
3. Ensuring comprehensive test coverage for all components
4. Providing thorough documentation for all implemented features

## Future Work

This implementation lays the groundwork for future enhancements:

- Machine learning-based domain detection
- Dynamic profile adjustment based on task context
- Collaborative profile editing and sharing
- Historical metrics visualization and trend analysis

## Related Issues

- Resolves #XXX: Domain-specific governance profiles
- Resolves #XXX: UI reorganization for Phase 6.5
- Resolves #XXX: Governance metrics visualization
- Resolves #XXX: Trust log component technical debt

## Breaking Changes

None. This implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing governance systems.

## Reviewer Notes

Please pay special attention to:

1. The integration between UI components and the governance backend
2. The accuracy of domain-specific metrics calculations
3. The extensibility of the profile system for future domains
4. The refactored trust_log components and their test coverage
