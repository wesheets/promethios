# Promethios Test Analysis and Extension System Requirements

## Test Failure Analysis

After multiple attempts to fix the test failures in the Promethios visualization system, I've identified several persistent issues:

### Mock Call Requirements
The tests expect the following mock methods to be called during execution:
- `governance_primitive_manager.get_current_state()`
- `governance_primitive_manager.get_current_health_report()`
- `governance_primitive_manager.get_issue_report()`
- `governance_primitive_manager.get_issue_details(issue_id)`
- `trust_decay_engine.get_current_metrics()`
- `trust_decay_engine.get_metric_details(metric_id)`

### Data Structure Requirements
The tests expect specific keys in returned data structures:
- Dashboard data must include: `governance_state`, `trust_metrics`, `health_report`
- Visualization data must include: `overall_health`, `component_health`, `issues`, `recommendations`
- Issue report must include: `summary`, `issues`, `component_issues`, `timestamp`
- Metric details must include: `id`, `name`, `value`, `trend`

## Extension System Requirements

Based on the analysis of the existing code and documentation, the extension system should:

1. **Support Module Registration**: Allow modules to be registered with the system
2. **Feature Toggling**: Provide a mechanism to enable/disable features
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with existing code
4. **Extension Points**: Define clear extension points for UI components
5. **Dependency Management**: Handle dependencies between extensions

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a separate test file that properly tests the extension system
2. Implement the extension system based on the requirements
3. Document the extension system architecture and usage
4. Validate the implementation against the requirements

## Extension System Architecture

The extension system will consist of:

1. **ExtensionRegistry**: Manages extensions and their lifecycle
2. **ModuleRegistry**: Manages modules and their dependencies
3. **FeatureToggleService**: Controls feature availability

These components will work together to provide a flexible and robust extension system for the Promethios UI.
