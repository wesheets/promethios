# Phase 6.3.2 Migration Guide

## Overview

This migration guide provides comprehensive instructions for transitioning to Phase 6.3.2 of the Promethios system, which introduces the Constitutional Governance Framework, Versioned Behavior System, and Governance Wrapping mechanisms. These foundational changes are required before merging Phase 6.4, as they provide the infrastructure needed to properly govern behavioral changes.

## Key Components

Phase 6.3.2 introduces three major components:

1. **Constitutional Governance Framework**: A formal system for documenting, reviewing, and governing all behavioral changes through constitutional amendments
2. **Versioned Behavior System**: An explicit versioning system for behavioral semantics, allowing tests and code to bind to specific behavior versions
3. **Governance Wrapping**: A mechanism for instrumenting all modules with governance controls without altering their core functionality

## Migration Steps

### 1. Directory Structure Updates

Create the following directory structure for governance artifacts:

```
promethios_repo/
├── codex/
│   ├── amendments/     # Constitutional amendments
│   ├── behaviors/      # Behavior changelog and documentation
│   ├── migrations/     # Migration checklists and guides
│   └── tools/          # Governance tools (CRITIC agent, etc.)
└── src/
    ├── governance_wrapping/  # Governance wrapping infrastructure
    └── versioned_behavior/   # Versioned behavior infrastructure
```

### 2. Configuration Updates

Add the following configuration options to your Promethios configuration:

```json
{
  "behavior_version": "6.4.0",
  "legacy_compatibility": true,
  "strict_mode": false,
  "trust_system_endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/trust",
  "trust_report_batch_size": 10,
  "amendments_dir": "/codex/amendments"
}
```

These can also be set via environment variables:

```bash
export PROMETHIOS_BEHAVIOR_VERSION="6.4.0"
export PROMETHIOS_LEGACY_COMPATIBILITY="true"
export PROMETHIOS_STRICT_MODE="false"
export PROMETHIOS_TRUST_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:8000/trust"
export PROMETHIOS_TRUST_BATCH_SIZE="10"
export PROMETHIOS_AMENDMENTS_DIR="/codex/amendments"
```

### 3. Import Updates

Update your imports to use the new governance-wrapped modules:

```python
# Before
from promethios.core import Engine

# After
from promethios.core import Engine  # Now automatically governance-wrapped
```

For explicit versioned behavior:

```python
from promethios.versioned_behavior.core import with_behavior_version, BehaviorContext

# Use decorator for function-level versioning
@with_behavior_version("pre_6.4")
def legacy_function():
    # This function will use pre-6.4 behavior

# Use context manager for block-level versioning
def mixed_function():
    # Default behavior (6.4.0)
    result1 = some_operation()
    
    # Explicit legacy behavior
    with BehaviorContext("pre_6.4"):
        result2 = some_operation()
```

### 4. Test Updates

Update your tests to use the versioned behavior system:

```python
from promethios.versioned_behavior.core import with_behavior_version

# Test with specific behavior version
@with_behavior_version("pre_6.4")
def test_legacy_behavior():
    # This test will use pre-6.4 behavior
    assert result.state == "completed"  # Pre-6.4 always uses "completed"

# Test with current behavior version
def test_current_behavior():
    # This test will use current behavior (6.4.0)
    assert result.state == "aborted"  # 6.4.0 uses "aborted" for resource limits
```

### 5. Constitutional Amendment Process

When making behavioral changes, follow this process:

1. Create a new amendment file in `codex/amendments/` using the template
2. Fill in all required sections, including current behavior, proposed behavior, and migration path
3. Run the CRITIC agent to analyze philosophical implications:
   ```bash
   python -m codex.tools.critic_agent codex/amendments/CGF-YYYY-NN.md
   ```
4. Generate a migration checklist:
   ```bash
   python -m codex.tools.migration_generator codex/amendments/CGF-YYYY-NN.md -o codex/migrations/checklist.md
   ```
5. Update the CHANGELOG.md with the behavioral change
6. Implement the change with proper versioning

### 6. Governance Wrapping Integration

To apply governance wrapping to all modules:

```python
from promethios.governance_wrapping.integration import apply_governance_wrapping

# Apply wrapping to all modules
wrapped_modules = apply_governance_wrapping()

# Install import hook for future imports
from promethios.governance_wrapping.integration import install_import_hook
install_import_hook()
```

## Behavioral Changes

Phase 6.3.2 itself does not change any system behaviors, but it introduces the infrastructure needed to properly govern the behavioral changes in Phase 6.4, including:

1. Loop termination state for resource limits and timeouts (changing from 'completed' to 'aborted')
2. Recovery mechanism preserving new state keys during checkpoint recovery
3. Error recovery maintaining 'failed' state for diagnostic purposes
4. New monitoring events for recovery operations

## Verification Steps

After migration, verify the following:

1. All modules are properly wrapped with governance controls
2. Memory logs include behavior version information
3. Trust system receives reports from all modules
4. Tests can bind to specific behavior versions
5. Constitutional amendments are properly documented
6. CHANGELOG.md is updated with all behavioral changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Module not found errors**: Ensure the directory structure is correct and all modules are properly installed
2. **AttributeError in wrapped modules**: Check that the governance wrapping is properly applied and all required attributes are exposed
3. **Behavior version mismatch**: Verify that the correct behavior version is set in configuration or context

### Diagnostic Tools

Use these tools to diagnose issues:

```python
# Check active behavior version
from promethios.versioned_behavior.core import BehaviorRegistry
print(BehaviorRegistry.get_active_version())

# Check wrapped modules
from promethios.governance_wrapping.integration import ModuleRegistry
registry = ModuleRegistry.get_instance()
print(registry.list_modules())
```
