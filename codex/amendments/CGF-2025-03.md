# Constitutional Amendment
## Metadata
- **Amendment ID**: CGF-2025-03
- **Title**: Monitoring Event Enhancement for Recovery Operations
- **Author**: Promethios Governance Team
- **Date Proposed**: 2025-05-25
- **Status**: Draft
- **Behavior Version**: 6.4.0
- **Affected Components**: Monitoring Integration in the Continuous Monitoring Framework

## Summary
This amendment formalizes the semantic change in how monitoring events are generated during recovery operations. Prior to Phase 6.4, the monitoring system would record 2 events during recovery operations (checkpoint creation and recovery). Phase 6.4 introduces more granular event reporting, generating 4 events that provide additional context about the recovery process, enabling better observability and governance.

## Motivation
The previous monitoring model provided limited visibility into recovery operations, capturing only the beginning and end states. By introducing more granular event reporting, the system provides deeper insights into the recovery process, enabling better governance, auditing, and debugging. This change aligns with Promethios' commitment to comprehensive observability and governance transparency.

## Current Behavior
In the pre-6.4 behavior, when performing recovery operations, the monitoring system would record 2 events:

```python
# Pre-6.4 behavior
def create_checkpoint(self, state):
    checkpoint_id = self._generate_checkpoint_id()
    self.checkpoints[checkpoint_id] = state.copy()
    
    # Generate checkpoint creation event
    self.monitor.emit_event({
        "type": "checkpoint_created",
        "checkpoint_id": checkpoint_id,
        "timestamp": time.time()
    })
    
    return checkpoint_id

def recover_from_checkpoint(self, checkpoint_id):
    checkpoint_state = self.checkpoints.get(checkpoint_id, {})
    
    # Generate recovery event
    self.monitor.emit_event({
        "type": "checkpoint_recovered",
        "checkpoint_id": checkpoint_id,
        "timestamp": time.time()
    })
    
    return checkpoint_state.copy()
```

## Proposed Behavior
In the 6.4.0 behavior, when performing recovery operations, the monitoring system records 4 events, providing additional context about the recovery process:

```python
# 6.4.0 behavior
def create_checkpoint(self, state):
    checkpoint_id = self._generate_checkpoint_id()
    self.checkpoints[checkpoint_id] = state.copy()
    
    # Generate checkpoint creation event
    self.monitor.emit_event({
        "type": "checkpoint_created",
        "checkpoint_id": checkpoint_id,
        "timestamp": time.time()
    })
    
    # Generate state snapshot event
    self.monitor.emit_event({
        "type": "state_snapshot",
        "checkpoint_id": checkpoint_id,
        "state_size": len(state),
        "timestamp": time.time()
    })
    
    return checkpoint_id

def recover_from_checkpoint(self, checkpoint_id):
    checkpoint_state = self.checkpoints.get(checkpoint_id, {})
    current_state = self.get_current_state()
    
    # Generate recovery initiated event
    self.monitor.emit_event({
        "type": "recovery_initiated",
        "checkpoint_id": checkpoint_id,
        "timestamp": time.time()
    })
    
    merged_state = {**current_state, **checkpoint_state}
    
    # Generate recovery completed event
    self.monitor.emit_event({
        "type": "recovery_completed",
        "checkpoint_id": checkpoint_id,
        "state_delta": len(merged_state) - len(checkpoint_state),
        "timestamp": time.time()
    })
    
    return merged_state
```

## Philosophical Implications
This change represents a shift toward more comprehensive observability and governance transparency, aligning with Promethios' principles of accountability and informed governance.

The introduction of more granular event reporting reflects a deeper philosophical understanding that governance requires detailed visibility into system operations. By providing additional context about the recovery process, the system enables more informed governance decisions and better accountability.

The additional events also reflect a commitment to transparency in system operations, ensuring that all relevant information is available for governance, auditing, and debugging purposes. This transparency is essential for building trust in the system and ensuring that governance decisions are based on complete information.

## Backward Compatibility
This change affects existing tests and systems that expect exactly 2 events during recovery operations. To maintain backward compatibility:

1. A versioned behavior system will be implemented, allowing systems to explicitly opt into either pre-6.4 or 6.4.0 behaviors.
2. Event filtering options will be provided to maintain backward compatibility where needed.
3. Migration guides will be created to help developers adapt to the new event generation patterns.

## Implementation Requirements
1. Update the Monitoring Integration to generate additional events during recovery operations.
2. Implement a versioned behavior adapter for monitoring event generation.
3. Update tests to use the versioned behavior system.
4. Create migration guides and backward compatibility options.

## Governance Requirements
1. All monitoring events must include behavior version information.
2. Trust system must be aware of the additional events and their significance.
3. Reflection capabilities must be updated to reason about the additional monitoring context.
4. Override mechanisms must be aware of the additional monitoring events.

## Migration Path
1. Identify all code that depends on the monitoring event patterns.
2. Update code to use the versioned behavior system.
3. Test with both pre-6.4 and 6.4.0 behaviors to ensure compatibility.
4. Update documentation to reflect the new event generation patterns.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Maintain existing semantics**: Rejected because it would limit observability and governance transparency.
2. **Configuration-based event generation**: Considered implementing a configuration-based approach to event generation, but rejected in favor of a more consistent approach that ensures comprehensive observability by default.
3. **Event aggregation**: Considered aggregating events to maintain backward compatibility, but rejected because it would lose valuable context and detail.
