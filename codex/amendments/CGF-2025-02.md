# Constitutional Amendment
## Metadata
- **Amendment ID**: CGF-2025-02
- **Title**: Recovery Mechanism Enhancement for State Preservation
- **Author**: Promethios Governance Team
- **Date Proposed**: 2025-05-25
- **Status**: Draft
- **Behavior Version**: 6.4.0
- **Affected Components**: Loop Recovery Manager in the Loop Management System

## Summary
This amendment formalizes the semantic change in how state is preserved during recovery operations in the Loop Management System. Prior to Phase 6.4, checkpoint recovery would restore only the exact state that was checkpointed, excluding any keys added after the checkpoint was created. Phase 6.4 introduces a more comprehensive recovery approach that preserves the full state context, including keys added after checkpoint creation, providing better continuity of operations.

## Motivation
The previous recovery model created artificial boundaries in state preservation, potentially losing valuable context added between checkpoint creation and recovery. By preserving the full state context during recovery, the system maintains a more complete operational history, enabling better governance, auditing, and debugging. This change aligns with Promethios' commitment to comprehensive state awareness and contextual integrity.

## Current Behavior
In the pre-6.4 behavior, when recovering from a checkpoint, the recovery manager restores only the exact state that was checkpointed, discarding any keys added after the checkpoint was created:

```python
# Pre-6.4 behavior
def recover_from_checkpoint(self, checkpoint_id):
    checkpoint_state = self.checkpoints.get(checkpoint_id, {})
    return checkpoint_state.copy()  # Only returns the exact checkpointed state
```

Additionally, after error recovery, the state would transition from 'failed' to a different state, regardless of whether the recovery was successful:

```python
# Pre-6.4 behavior
def recover_from_error(self, error_info):
    # Recovery logic
    self.state["state"] = LoopState.RECOVERED.value  # Always transitions to RECOVERED
    return self.state
```

## Proposed Behavior
In the 6.4.0 behavior, when recovering from a checkpoint, the recovery manager preserves the full state context, including keys added after checkpoint creation:

```python
# 6.4.0 behavior
def recover_from_checkpoint(self, checkpoint_id):
    checkpoint_state = self.checkpoints.get(checkpoint_id, {})
    current_state = self.get_current_state()
    # Merge checkpoint state with current state, preserving newer additions
    merged_state = {**current_state, **checkpoint_state}
    return merged_state
```

Additionally, after error recovery, the state remains 'failed' if the recovery was not successful, providing more accurate state representation:

```python
# 6.4.0 behavior
def recover_from_error(self, error_info):
    # Recovery logic
    if recovery_successful:
        self.state["state"] = LoopState.RECOVERED.value
    # If recovery not successful, state remains FAILED
    return self.state
```

## Philosophical Implications
This change represents a shift toward more holistic state preservation and accurate representation of recovery outcomes, aligning with Promethios' governance principles of contextual integrity and truthfulness.

The preservation of full state context during recovery reflects a deeper philosophical understanding that a system's state is not just a snapshot at a point in time, but a continuous evolution of context. By preserving this context, the system maintains a more complete understanding of its operational history, enabling better governance decisions.

The decision to maintain the 'failed' state when recovery is unsuccessful reflects a commitment to truthful representation of system state. It acknowledges that not all recovery attempts succeed, and that governance systems should be aware of persistent failure states rather than having them masked by optimistic state transitions.

## Backward Compatibility
This change affects existing tests and systems that expect checkpoint recovery to exclude keys added after checkpoint creation, and that expect error recovery to always transition away from the 'failed' state. To maintain backward compatibility:

1. A versioned behavior system will be implemented, allowing systems to explicitly opt into either pre-6.4 or 6.4.0 behaviors.
2. Configuration options will be provided to maintain backward compatibility where needed.
3. Migration guides will be created to help developers adapt to the new semantic behaviors.

## Implementation Requirements
1. Update the Recovery Manager to preserve full state context during checkpoint recovery.
2. Update the Recovery Manager to maintain 'failed' state when recovery is unsuccessful.
3. Implement a versioned behavior adapter for recovery semantics.
4. Update tests to use the versioned behavior system.
5. Create migration guides and backward compatibility options.

## Governance Requirements
1. All recovery operations must be logged with behavior version information.
2. Trust system must be notified of all recovery operations.
3. Reflection capabilities must be updated to reason about the semantic changes in recovery.
4. Override mechanisms must be aware of the semantic changes in recovery.

## Migration Path
1. Identify all code that depends on the recovery semantics.
2. Update code to use the versioned behavior system.
3. Test with both pre-6.4 and 6.4.0 behaviors to ensure compatibility.
4. Update documentation to reflect the new semantic behaviors.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Maintain existing semantics**: Rejected because it would perpetuate artificial boundaries in state preservation and mask recovery failures.
2. **Selective state merging**: Considered implementing a more selective approach to state merging, but rejected in favor of a more comprehensive approach that preserves full context.
3. **Recovery state flags**: Considered adding additional state flags to indicate recovery status, but rejected in favor of a more direct approach that maintains the 'failed' state when appropriate.
