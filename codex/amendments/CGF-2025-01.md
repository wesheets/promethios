# Constitutional Amendment
## Metadata
- **Amendment ID**: CGF-2025-01
- **Title**: Loop State Semantics Enhancement for Resource Limits and Timeouts
- **Author**: Promethios Governance Team
- **Date Proposed**: 2025-05-25
- **Status**: Draft
- **Behavior Version**: 6.4.0
- **Affected Components**: Loop Controller in the Loop Management System

## Summary
This amendment formalizes the semantic distinction between normal completion and termination due to resource constraints or timeouts in the Loop Management System. Prior to Phase 6.4, all normal termination conditions (including resource limits and timeouts) would result in a `'completed'` state. Phase 6.4 introduces a more precise semantic distinction, using `'aborted'` state for terminations due to resource limits or timeouts, while reserving `'completed'` for successful, natural completions.

## Motivation
The previous semantic model lacked precision in distinguishing between different types of loop termination. By introducing a semantic distinction between natural completion and constraint-based termination, the system provides more accurate information about why a loop ended, enabling better governance, monitoring, and debugging. This change aligns with Promethios' commitment to transparency and precise state representation.

## Current Behavior
In the pre-6.4 behavior, when a loop terminates due to resource limits or timeouts, the loop state is set to `'completed'`. This creates ambiguity as both successful completions and constraint-based terminations share the same state, making it difficult to distinguish between them in logs, monitoring, and governance systems.

```python
# Pre-6.4 behavior
def handle_resource_limit_exceeded(self):
    self.state["state"] = LoopState.COMPLETED.value
    self.state["termination_reason"] = "resource_limit_exceeded"
    
def handle_timeout(self):
    self.state["state"] = LoopState.COMPLETED.value
    self.state["termination_reason"] = "timeout"
```

## Proposed Behavior
In the 6.4.0 behavior, when a loop terminates due to resource limits or timeouts, the loop state is set to `'aborted'` instead of `'completed'`. This creates a clear semantic distinction between successful completions and constraint-based terminations, enabling better governance, monitoring, and debugging.

```python
# 6.4.0 behavior
def handle_resource_limit_exceeded(self):
    self.state["state"] = LoopState.ABORTED.value
    self.state["termination_reason"] = "resource_limit_exceeded"
    
def handle_timeout(self):
    self.state["state"] = LoopState.ABORTED.value
    self.state["termination_reason"] = "timeout"
```

## Philosophical Implications
This change represents a shift toward more precise semantic representation of system states, aligning with Promethios' governance principles of transparency and accuracy. By distinguishing between different types of termination, the system provides more accurate information for governance decisions, audit trails, and human understanding.

The distinction between `'completed'` and `'aborted'` reflects a deeper philosophical understanding that not all terminations are equal. A natural completion represents the fulfillment of a process's purpose, while a constraint-based termination represents an external limitation being applied. This distinction is crucial for proper governance, as it allows the system to reason about whether a process achieved its intended goal or was curtailed by resource constraints.

## Backward Compatibility
This change affects existing tests and systems that expect resource limits and timeouts to result in a `'completed'` state. To maintain backward compatibility:

1. A versioned behavior system will be implemented, allowing systems to explicitly opt into either pre-6.4 or 6.4.0 behaviors.
2. Configuration options will be provided to maintain backward compatibility where needed.
3. Migration guides will be created to help developers adapt to the new semantic behaviors.

## Implementation Requirements
1. Update the Loop Controller to use `'aborted'` state for resource limits and timeouts.
2. Implement a versioned behavior adapter for loop state semantics.
3. Update tests to use the versioned behavior system.
4. Create migration guides and backward compatibility options.

## Governance Requirements
1. All loop state transitions must be logged with behavior version information.
2. Trust system must be notified of all state transitions.
3. Reflection capabilities must be updated to reason about the semantic distinction.
4. Override mechanisms must be aware of the semantic distinction.

## Migration Path
1. Identify all code that depends on the loop state semantics.
2. Update code to use the versioned behavior system.
3. Test with both pre-6.4 and 6.4.0 behaviors to ensure compatibility.
4. Update documentation to reflect the new semantic distinction.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Maintain existing semantics**: Rejected because it would perpetuate ambiguity in state representation.
2. **Add additional state fields**: Considered adding more detailed state fields instead of changing the primary state value, but rejected because it would not address the fundamental semantic issue and would require more complex logic to interpret.
3. **Use different state values**: Considered using different state values like `'resource_limited'` or `'timed_out'`, but rejected in favor of the more general `'aborted'` to maintain a clean state model.
