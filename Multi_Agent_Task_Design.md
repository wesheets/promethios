# Multi-Agent Collaboration Task Design

## Overview
To properly demonstrate Promethios governance in multi-agent scenarios, we need tasks that **require** handoffs between agents with different specializations.

## Task Design Principles

### 1. **Forced Dependencies**
- Each agent has **unique capabilities** that others cannot replicate
- **Sequential dependencies** where Agent B cannot start until Agent A completes
- **Parallel coordination** where multiple agents work simultaneously but must sync

### 2. **Clear Handoff Triggers**
- **Explicit completion criteria** for each agent's portion
- **Defined output formats** that next agent expects
- **Validation checkpoints** before handoff occurs

### 3. **Governance Checkpoints**
- **Trust verification** at each handoff
- **Policy compliance** checks during transitions
- **Quality validation** before accepting handoff

## Multi-Agent Scenario Examples

### Scenario 1: "Product Launch Analysis"
**Agents Required:** Research Agent, Data Analyst, Marketing Strategist, Financial Analyst

**Workflow:**
1. **Research Agent** (2-3 sub-tasks)
   - Gather competitor analysis
   - Research market trends
   - **→ HANDOFF** → Raw research data to Data Analyst

2. **Data Analyst** (2-3 sub-tasks)
   - Process research data
   - Create statistical models
   - **→ HANDOFF** → Analysis results to Marketing & Financial (parallel)

3. **Marketing Strategist** (2-3 sub-tasks)
   - Develop positioning strategy
   - Create campaign recommendations
   - **→ HANDOFF** → Marketing plan to Financial Analyst

4. **Financial Analyst** (2-3 sub-tasks)
   - Calculate ROI projections
   - Assess budget requirements
   - **→ FINAL OUTPUT** → Complete launch recommendation

**Total Sub-tasks:** ~10-12 (simulates CMU-style granular progress)

### Scenario 2: "Code Review & Deployment Pipeline"
**Agents Required:** Code Reviewer, Security Analyst, DevOps Engineer, QA Tester

**Workflow:**
1. **Code Reviewer** 
   - Review code quality
   - Check coding standards
   - **→ HANDOFF** → Approved code to Security Analyst

2. **Security Analyst**
   - Scan for vulnerabilities
   - Validate security practices
   - **→ HANDOFF** → Security-cleared code to QA Tester

3. **QA Tester**
   - Run automated tests
   - Perform integration testing
   - **→ HANDOFF** → Tested code to DevOps Engineer

4. **DevOps Engineer**
   - Deploy to staging
   - Monitor deployment
   - **→ FINAL OUTPUT** → Production deployment report

### Scenario 3: "Customer Support Escalation"
**Agents Required:** Support Agent, Technical Specialist, Manager, Customer Success

**Workflow:**
1. **Support Agent**
   - Initial customer triage
   - Gather problem details
   - **→ HANDOFF** → Complex issue to Technical Specialist

2. **Technical Specialist**
   - Deep technical analysis
   - Develop solution approach
   - **→ HANDOFF** → Solution plan to Manager (if escalation needed)

3. **Manager**
   - Approve solution approach
   - Allocate resources
   - **→ HANDOFF** → Approved plan to Customer Success

4. **Customer Success**
   - Implement solution
   - Follow up with customer
   - **→ FINAL OUTPUT** → Resolution report

## Governance Benefits Demonstration

### **Ungoverned Multi-Agent Issues:**
- **Skipped handoffs** - Agents try to do everything themselves
- **Poor communication** - Missing context in handoffs
- **Duplicate work** - Multiple agents working on same sub-task
- **Quality issues** - No validation at handoff points
- **Coordination failures** - Agents working out of sequence

### **Governed Multi-Agent Benefits:**
- **Enforced handoff protocols** - Cannot skip required handoffs
- **Trust verification** - Each handoff validated for quality
- **Policy compliance** - Governance rules enforced at transitions
- **Audit trail** - Complete record of all handoffs and decisions
- **Conflict resolution** - Governance mediates agent disagreements

## Implementation in Chat Interface

### **Visual Handoff Indicators:**
- **Agent status cards** show "Waiting for handoff from Agent X"
- **Handoff animations** when data transfers between agents
- **Governance checkpoints** highlighted during transitions
- **Trust scores** updated at each handoff

### **Metrics Tracking:**
- **Handoff success rate** (governed vs ungoverned)
- **Coordination efficiency** (time between handoffs)
- **Quality scores** (validation success at handoffs)
- **Policy compliance** (governance rule adherence)

This approach ensures we demonstrate the **real value** of governance in complex multi-agent scenarios where coordination is critical.
