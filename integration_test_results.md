# Integration Test Results - Master Integration Branch

## Test Run: June 10, 2025

### Summary
- **Branch**: master-integration (after merging clean-ui-restore)
- **Status**: Partial failures
- **Failed Tests**: 206 failures, primarily in VigilObserver tests

### VigilObserver Test Failures
The majority of test failures are related to the VigilObserver component. These failures appear to be related to:

1. **Metric calculation discrepancies**:
   - Expected vs. actual metric counts don't match
   - Severity categorization issues
   - Rule-based metrics showing incorrect counts

2. **Compliance status analysis**:
   - Compliance score calculation failures
   - Empty violations and enforcements handling issues

3. **Data persistence issues**:
   - Data not being properly persisted to storage
   - Error handling during persistence operations
   - Data loading failures

### Next Steps
1. These failures are expected as part of the integration process and will be addressed when merging the Veritas dashboard integration components
2. The VigilObserver component will be updated with the correct implementations from the veritas-dashboard-integration branch
3. We will proceed with incremental merging of components from the veritas-dashboard-integration branch
4. After each component merge, we will run targeted tests to ensure stability

### Action Items
- [ ] Document baseline test failures for comparison after merges
- [ ] Prioritize VigilObserver component fixes during the merge process
- [ ] Create specific test cases to verify fixes for each failure category
