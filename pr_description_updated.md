# PR Update: UI Cleanup, Path Verification, and Demo Readiness

## Summary
This PR update addresses several UI and script cleanup items, verifies all pathing for logs and replay scripts, and confirms the Promethios UI Justification Surface is fully operational and demo-ready when hosted in the Linux sandbox environment. Key issues resolved include duplicate script removal, unused static file deletion, and clarification of the manual replay execution path.

## Changes in this Update

*   **Deleted Duplicate Script:** Removed the redundant `test_deterministic_replay.py` from `/promethios_ui_surface/src/`.
*   **Deleted Unused Static File:** Removed the unused `index.html` from `/promethios_ui_surface/src/static/`.
*   **Path Verification:** Confirmed all log, template, and replay script paths in `governance_core.py`, `promethios_ui_surface/src/config.py`, and `promethios_ui_surface/src/main.py` are canonical and correct.
*   **UI Functionality Confirmed in Sandbox:**
    *   Successfully started the UI Flask server in the Linux sandbox.
    *   Exposed the UI via public URL: `https://5001-i8bvxbn9v5obisjvn0gf4-163e53ab.manus.computer` (Note: This URL is temporary and was for testing; a new one will be generated if the server is restarted).
    *   Verified all navigation links (Home, Emotion Telemetry Logs, Justification Logs, Log Integrity Check, Manual Replay) are functional.
*   **Log Regeneration and Integrity:**
    *   Reran deterministic replay to populate logs with fresh, hash-embedded data.
    *   Confirmed schema validation and hash integrity checks PASS for all logs.

## Original PR Purpose (Hash Embedding - Still Valid)
This PR also includes the previously implemented hash embedding and chain integrity for Promethios governance logs, ensuring all log entries include SHA256 hashes calculated at write-time and maintaining chain integrity through previous entry hash references.

## Testing
All tests have passed successfully:
- ✅ Hash embedding in log writes
- ✅ Deterministic replay test (generates 3 log entries per file)
- ✅ Log generation in canonical location (`/logs/`)
- ✅ SHA256 manifest generation and validation
- ✅ Hash integrity verification (UI and backend)
- ✅ /loop/execute endpoint functionality
- ✅ Log schema compliance
- ✅ UI component integration (log viewing, integrity check, manual replay)

**A comprehensive UI Cleanup and Verification Report is attached to this PR (`ui_cleanup_verification_report.md`).**

## Impact
This implementation ensures that Promethios can be showcased as a governance-first kernel with robust audit capabilities. The UI is clean, functional, and ready for the developer demo when hosted in the Linux sandbox.

## Next Steps
1.  Review and merge this PR.
2.  For the demo, ensure the UI server (`promethios_ui_surface/src/main.py`) is run from within the Linux sandbox and the port is exposed for the developer to access.
