# Phase 6.5.1 Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for Phase 6.5.1 of the Promethios project, which focuses on resolving all technical debt in the trust_log components before proceeding to Phase 7.0. This aligns with the Promethios Codex principle of resolving all technical debt before moving forward.

## Objectives
1. Refactor ReplayLogViewer to use React hooks and fix act() warnings
2. Implement robust fetch mocks for all trust_log API endpoints
3. Standardize module system across all trust_log components
4. Improve schema validation mocking in trust_log tests
5. Ensure all tests pass successfully

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Refactor ReplayLogViewer Component
- Convert class component to functional component with hooks
- Replace setState calls with useState and useEffect
- Ensure all asynchronous operations are properly handled
- Update component lifecycle methods to use hooks equivalents

### 2. Implement Robust Fetch Mocks
- Create comprehensive mock implementations for all API endpoints
- Ensure mocks handle all code paths and edge cases
- Implement proper error handling for fetch operations
- Update test setup to consistently apply fetch mocks

### 3. Standardize Module System
- Convert all CommonJS require() calls to ESModule import statements
- Update export syntax to use consistent patterns
- Ensure Jest and Babel configurations properly handle ESModules
- Verify all import paths are correct after standardization

### 4. Improve Schema Validation
- Create proper mock schemas for testing
- Implement a mock for the Ajv validation process
- Add conditional validation that can be disabled in test environments
- Ensure schema validation errors are properly handled

### 5. Testing and Validation
- Run the full test suite after each major change
- Verify that all tests pass successfully
- Ensure no new warnings or errors are introduced
- Document any remaining issues or edge cases

## Timeline
- Estimated completion: 3-5 days
- Priority: High (blocking for Phase 7.0)

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass successfully with no warnings or errors
- Code follows consistent patterns and best practices
- Technical debt is fully resolved according to Promethios Codex principles
- Documentation is updated to reflect all changes

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Complex component refactoring may introduce new bugs
  - **Mitigation**: Incremental changes with frequent testing
- **Risk**: Test environment configuration issues may persist
  - **Mitigation**: Thorough audit of Jest and Babel configurations
- **Risk**: Interdependencies between components may complicate fixes
  - **Mitigation**: Systematic approach with clear component boundaries

## Conclusion
This plan provides a clear roadmap for resolving all technical debt in the trust_log components as part of Phase 6.5.1. By following this plan, we will ensure that the codebase is fully compliant with the Promethios Codex principles before proceeding to Phase 7.0.
