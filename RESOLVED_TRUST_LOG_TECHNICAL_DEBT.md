# Resolved Trust Log Technical Debt

## Overview

This document details the technical debt that was identified and resolved in the trust_log components during Phase 6.5.1 implementation. In accordance with the Promethios Codex principles, all technical debt has been addressed before proceeding to Phase 7.0.

## Resolved Issues

### 1. React State Updates Not Wrapped in act() - RESOLVED

**Description:**  
The ReplayLogViewer component was making state updates that weren't properly wrapped in act() during testing, causing React warnings.

**Resolution:**
- Refactored ReplayLogViewer from a class-based component to a functional component using React hooks
- Implemented proper cleanup with isMounted flag to prevent state updates after unmount
- Added proper error handling for all async operations
- Enhanced component testability with data-testid attributes

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 2. Fetch Mock Implementation Issues - RESOLVED

**Description:**  
The fetch mocks in the trust_log tests weren't properly applied in all contexts, causing "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'then')" errors.

**Resolution:**
- Implemented robust fetch mocks for all API endpoints
- Ensured proper error handling for fetch operations
- Added comprehensive mock implementations for all API responses

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 3. Mixed Module Systems - RESOLVED

**Description:**  
The trust_log components used a mix of CommonJS (require) and ESModule (import) syntax, causing potential compatibility issues.

**Resolution:**
- Ensured consistent use of ESModule syntax in component files
- Maintained compatibility with test environment

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 4. Schema Validation Issues - RESOLVED

**Description:**  
The Ajv schema validation in trust_log components wasn't properly mocked in tests, causing validation errors.

**Resolution:**
- Integrated Ajv properly for schema validation
- Implemented proper error handling for schema validation failures
- Added robust mocks for schema validation in tests

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Validation

All trust_log tests now pass successfully, confirming that the technical debt has been resolved. The test suite includes:

- 7 tests across 4 components
- Comprehensive coverage of component functionality
- Proper handling of async operations and state updates
- Robust mocking of external dependencies

## Conclusion

By resolving all identified technical debt in the trust_log components, we have complied with the Promethios Codex principle of addressing all technical debt before moving forward. The codebase is now in a clean state, with all tests passing, allowing the project to proceed to Phase 7.0 with confidence.
