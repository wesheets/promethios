# Holistic Admin Dashboard Integration Plan

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive integration plan for a holistic admin dashboard within the Promethios system. The dashboard will serve as a central hub for administrators, providing access to all system metrics, user account management, role-based access control (RBAC) configuration, agent management, and Emotional Veritas 2.0 settings. This plan emphasizes a scalable architecture, leveraging the existing extension system and Firebase for backend services.

## 2. Core Architectural Principles

- **Modularity**: Dashboard components will be modular and managed by the ExtensionRegistry and ModuleRegistry.
- **Scalability**: The architecture will support the addition of new metrics and administrative features over time.
- **Consistency**: A unified UI/UX will be maintained across all dashboard sections.
- **Security**: Robust access control will be enforced through Firebase authentication and RBAC.
- **Data Integrity**: Firebase will ensure data persistence and consistency for configurations and metrics.

## 3. Key Features and Modules

### 3.1 Main Dashboard View
- **Overview**: A summary page displaying key system health indicators, recent activity, and alerts.
- **Navigation**: A persistent sidebar or top navigation for accessing different dashboard modules.
- **Customization**: Ability for admins to customize their dashboard view (future enhancement).

### 3.2 Metrics Management Module

## 4. Technical Implementation Details

### 4.1 Frontend (React & TypeScript)
- **Component Library**: Utilize existing UI components and patterns for consistency.
- **State Management**: Employ existing state management solutions (e.g., Context API, Zustand) for dashboard state.
- **Routing**: Integrate with the existing routing mechanism for dashboard pages.
- **Admin Header Link**: A dedicated link in the main application header, visible only to authenticated admin users, leading to `/admin/dashboard`.

### 4.2 Extension System Integration
- **DashboardModule Interface**: Define a standard interface for dashboard modules.
  ```typescript
  interface DashboardModule {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    icon?: string; // For navigation
    component: React.ComponentType;
    requiredPermissions?: string[]; // Permissions needed to access this module
    routePath: string;
  }
  ```
- **Registration**: Dashboard modules will register themselves with the ModuleRegistry.
- **Dynamic Loading**: The main dashboard component will dynamically load and render registered modules based on user permissions.

### 4.3 Firebase Integration

#### 4.3.1 Authentication & Authorization
- **Firebase Authentication**: Used for user sign-in and session management.
- **Custom Claims**: Firebase Custom Claims will be used to store user roles (e.g., `admin: true`). Frontend and backend (Firebase Rules) will use these claims to enforce access control.
- **Admin SDK**: A secure backend function (e.g., Firebase Cloud Function) will be used to set custom claims when an admin assigns a role.

#### 4.3.2 Firestore Database Structure
- **`/users/{userId}`**: Stores user-specific information (display name, email, etc., synced from Firebase Auth where possible).
- **`/users/{userId}/agents/{agentId}`**: Stores individual agent data tied to specific users.
- **`/users/{userId}/agentSystems/{systemId}`**: Stores multi-agent system configurations.
- **`/users/{userId}/agentSystems/{systemId}/agents/{agentId}`**: Maps agents to systems within a user's account.
- **`/roles/{roleId}`**: Defines roles and their associated permissions.
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Administrator",
    "permissions": ["manageUsers", "viewAllMetrics", "configureSystem"]
  }
  ```
- **`/userRoles/{userId}`**: Maps users to roles.
  ```json
  {
    "roles": ["adminRoleId1", "editorRoleId2"]
  }
  ```
- **`/dashboardConfig/{configId}`**: Stores dashboard-specific configurations (e.g., Emotional Veritas thresholds).
- **`/metrics/{metricType}/{timestamp}`**: Stores aggregated metrics data for dashboard visualization. (Consider time-series optimized structures or BigQuery for large volumes).
- **`/featureToggles/{toggleId}`**: Stores feature toggle states, managed by FeatureToggleService with Firebase persistence.
- **`/vigilObservations/{timestamp}`**: Stores Vigil observer data for analytics.
- **`/prismMonitoring/{timestamp}`**: Stores PRISM monitoring data for analytics.

#### 4.3.3 Firebase Security Rules
- Firestore Security Rules will be meticulously crafted to:
  - Allow admins to read/write configuration and user management data.
  - Allow authenticated users to read their own data and agents.
  - Restrict access to sensitive metrics based on roles.
  - Example (simplified):
    ```javascript
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth.uid == userId || isAdmin();
      allow write: if isAdmin();
    }
    
    match /users/{userId}/agents/{agentId} {
      allow read: if request.auth.uid == userId || isAdmin();
      allow write: if request.auth.uid == userId || isAdmin();
    }
    
    match /roles/{roleId} {
      allow read, write: if isAdmin();
    }
    
    function isAdmin() {
      return request.auth.token.admin == true;
    }
    ```

### 4.4 Navigation
- **Admin Header Link**: Implement a link in the main application header (e.g., `Header.tsx`).
  - Visibility will be controlled based on the user's `admin` custom claim from Firebase Auth.
  - The link will navigate to a base admin route (e.g., `/admin/dashboard`).
- **Dashboard Internal Navigation**: A sidebar or tabbed navigation within the admin dashboard to switch between modules (Metrics, User Management, RBAC, etc.).
