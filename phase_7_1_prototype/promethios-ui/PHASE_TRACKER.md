- [x] Challenge toggle for testing governance boundaries
- [x] Suggested prompts categorized by industry
- [x] Promethios observer commentary panel
- [x] Session reset functionality

#### Metrics and Visualization
- [x] Trust score calculation and display
- [x] Compliance rate metrics
- [x] Error rate tracking
- [x] Trust score delta visualization
- [x] Trust score divergence chart showing governed vs. ungoverned performance over time
- [x] Risk accumulator component showing increasing risk for ungoverned agents
- [x] Drift factor visualization for ungoverned agents
- [x] Violation impact tracking

#### Governance Features
- [x] Governance trace viewer with constitutional principles
- [x] Legal audit language in trace logs
- [x] Attribution of which constitutional principles were invoked
- [x] Detailed explanation of governance decisions
- [x] Metric explanation modal with educational content

#### Export and Reporting
- [x] Session export functionality
- [x] Multiple export formats (JSON, HTML, Text)
- [x] Enterprise-grade audit formatting
- [x] Comprehensive session reports with all metrics and messages

#### UI/UX Improvements
- [x] Enter key functionality for all chat boxes
- [x] Clickable recommended prompts
- [x] Dark/light mode support
- [x] Responsive design for all screen sizes
- [x] Interactive metrics with detailed explanations
- [x] "Try to Break It" section with governance-challenging prompts

#### Strategic Narrative Enhancements
- [x] Both agents starting at same trust level (45) to demonstrate governance value
- [x] Visual trust delta showing divergence over time
- [x] Risk level visualization showing increasing danger in ungoverned agents
- [x] Comparative metrics between agents

### Recently Fixed Issues
- [x] Missing MetricExplanationModal component added
- [x] Trust Score Delta NaN bug fixed when scores are equal
- [x] Layout regression fixed, restoring original "Governed vs. Ungoverned AI" title
- [x] Build dependencies updated and installed

### In Progress
- [ ] Full validation of all features and layout
- [ ] Comprehensive testing of all user flows
- [ ] Final documentation updates

### Planned Enhancements (Phase 7.2)

#### Social Virality Features
- [ ] "Copy My Simulation" button for shareable links
- [ ] Leaderboard of prompts with most violations prevented
- [ ] "Show me what this agent got wrong" toggle
- [ ] Badges and achievements for discovering different violations

#### Investor-Focused Features
- [ ] "Investor Cheat Mode" with simplified view
- [ ] "See a Real Agent Failure" button that replays from gallery
- [ ] Executive summary generation
- [ ] Simplified dashboard showing key metrics

#### API Integration Improvements
- [ ] Full OpenAI API integration for all chat interfaces
- [ ] Dynamic Promethios observer commentary based on actual responses
- [ ] Real-time metrics based on actual agent responses
- [ ] Authentic violation detection from live responses

## Development Timeline

### Phase 7.1 (Current)
- Initial simulator prototype
- Basic metrics and visualization
- Governance trace viewer
- Session export functionality
- UI/UX improvements
- Strategic narrative enhancements

### Phase 7.2 (Planned)
- Social virality features
- Investor-focused features
- Full API integration
- Enhanced metrics and visualization
- Performance optimizations

### Phase 7.3 (Future)
- Enterprise deployment features
