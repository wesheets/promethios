# Promethios Chat Interface Issues & Solutions

## âœ… COMPLETED FIXES:
- [x] Fixed browser compatibility (`require()` errors)
- [x] Fixed Firebase authentication issues
- [x] Fixed infinite loop in useEffect dependencies
- [x] Fixed missing `useMemo` import
- [x] Identified root cause of chat message display issue

## ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT STATUS:
**Chat functionality is working** - messages are processed, responses generated, and data saved.
**Problem**: Routing loops cause App re-renders which reset component state.

## ðŸ”§ REMAINING TASKS:

### High Priority:
- [ ] Implement state persistence for chat messages using localStorage
- [ ] Add state restoration logic to survive component re-mounts
- [ ] Test chat message display after state persistence fix
- [ ] Verify console spam reduction

### Medium Priority:
- [ ] Fix routing loops in ProtectedRoute component (complex, risky)
- [ ] Optimize service initialization to prevent duplication
- [ ] Test tool integration functionality
- [ ] Implement proper receipts system integration

### Low Priority:
- [ ] Add error boundaries for better error handling
- [ ] Optimize performance and reduce bundle size
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for debugging

## ðŸ“‹ TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Chat messages ARE being processed successfully
- Backend API calls are working (200 responses)
- Firebase storage is working properly
- Issue is purely UI state management during re-renders
