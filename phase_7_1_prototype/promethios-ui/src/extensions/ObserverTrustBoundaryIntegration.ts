Trust boundaries define secure interaction rules between your agents. Here's what you'll need to specify:

🎯 **Source & Target Agents**: Choose which agents will have this trust relationship
🔒 **Trust Level**: Set the minimum trust score required (I recommend starting with 75% for general collaboration)
📋 **Boundary Type**: 
   - **Direct**: Agent A trusts Agent B directly
   - **Delegated**: Agent A trusts Agent B because Agent C vouches for them
   - **Transitive**: Trust through a chain of relationships
   - **Federated**: Cross-organizational trust

🛡️ **Policies**: Define what actions are allowed (data sharing, task delegation, etc.)

Since you currently have 0 active boundaries, creating your first one will enable secure multi-agent collaboration!`;

🔄 **Reliability** (25%): Consistency in performance and availability  
✅ **Honesty** (25%): Truthfulness and accuracy of responses
🔍 **Transparency** (25%): Openness about capabilities and limitations

Your current average trust level is ${avgTrust.toFixed(1)}%. Here's how to interpret trust scores:

• **90-100%**: Excellent - Full collaboration capabilities
• **75-89%**: Good - Most collaboration types allowed
• **60-74%**: Moderate - Limited collaboration with oversight
• **Below 60%**: Poor - Restricted access, requires improvement

**Industry Standards:**
Apply pre-configured compliance templates:
- Financial services (SOX compliance)
- Healthcare (HIPAA compliance)

Connect governance policies to trust requirements:
- Access control policies
- Data handling policies

**Risk Factors to Monitor:**
🔴 **Trust Degradation**: Declining trust scores over time
🟡 **Policy Violations**: Non-compliance with governance rules
🟠 **Unusual Behavior**: Deviations from normal interaction patterns
⚫ **Communication Failures**: Increased error rates or timeouts

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Set up automated alerts for trust threshold breaches

4. Continuous monitoring of agent interactions

3. **Verify Trust**: Check current trust relationships and scores
4. **Establish Boundaries**: Create formal trust boundaries for collaboration

**Best Practices:**
- Start with high-trust agents for critical tasks
- Use graduated trust levels for different collaboration types
- Monitor collaboration success rates to refine partner selection
- Maintain diverse collaboration networks for resilience

**Agent Discovery Criteria:**
- Trust score thresholds
- Capability matching
- Policy compliance
- Geographic/organizational constraints
- Historical collaboration success

Trust boundaries are the foundation of secure multi-agent collaboration. They define:
- Which agents can interact with each other
- What level of trust is required for different operations
- How policies and compliance requirements are enforced
- When alerts and interventions are triggered

**Key Concepts:**
🔗 **Trust Relationships**: Formal connections between agents with defined trust levels
🎯 **Trust Thresholds**: Minimum trust scores required for specific actions
📋 **Policy Integration**: How governance policies map to trust requirements
⚡ **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous assessment of trust levels and compliance

Currently, you have ${this.currentContext?.trustMetrics.totalBoundaries || 0} active trust boundaries. 

What specific aspect of trust boundaries would you like to explore? I can help with:
- Creating new boundaries
- Understanding trust scores
- Configuring thresholds
- Risk assessment
