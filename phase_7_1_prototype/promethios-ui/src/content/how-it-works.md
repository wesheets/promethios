# How It Works

## The Technical Architecture Behind Promethios

Promethios isn't just another AI platform—it's a comprehensive governance framework that integrates directly with any AI agent's runtime environment. Our architecture is designed to enforce reflection, memory, and trust at every step of execution, creating a robust system for agent governance.

### Core Components

Promethios consists of three primary systems working in harmony:

#### 1. PRISM: Procedural Reflection and Introspection System for Models

PRISM enforces real-time reflection by intercepting agent actions and evaluating them against governance policies. Unlike traditional monitoring systems that operate after the fact, PRISM works at runtime to:

- Intercept agent actions before execution
- Apply governance rules and policies
- Force reflection on potential consequences
- Prevent harmful or non-compliant actions
- Log decision processes for transparency

```
Agent Action → PRISM Interception → Policy Evaluation → Reflection Enforcement → Approved Action
```

#### 2. VIGIL: Verification and Integrity Governance for Intelligent Layers

VIGIL maintains the integrity of the governance system itself, ensuring that:

- Governance policies cannot be bypassed
- Agent modifications are tracked and verified
- System integrity is continuously monitored
- Tampering attempts are detected and blocked
- Cryptographic verification of governance components

VIGIL creates a tamper-proof envelope around your AI systems, ensuring governance cannot be circumvented.

#### 3. CRITIC: Continuous Retrospective Improvement Through Introspective Cognition

CRITIC builds a persistent memory of agent behavior, enabling:

- Learning from past decisions and mistakes
- Continuous improvement of governance policies
- Pattern recognition across agent behaviors
- Anomaly detection and response
- Performance optimization without compromising safety

### Integration Process

Integrating Promethios with your existing AI agents takes minutes, not months:

1. **Wrap**: Encapsulate your agent with our governance layer
2. **Configure**: Set trust thresholds and compliance requirements
3. **Deploy**: Run your governed agent with minimal performance impact
4. **Monitor**: Track trust scores, compliance rates, and performance metrics

### Technical Specifications

Promethios is designed for enterprise-grade deployment:

- **Language Support**: Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++ integrations
- **Framework Compatibility**: Works with all major AI frameworks
- **Deployment Options**: On-premises, cloud, or hybrid
- **Latency Impact**: Typically <3% overhead
- **Scalability**: Handles millions of agent actions per second
- **Security**: SOC 2 compliant with end-to-end encryption

### Governance Dashboard

Our intuitive dashboard provides real-time visibility into your agent ecosystem:

- Trust scores across all agents
- Compliance metrics and violation alerts
- Performance impact monitoring
- Governance policy management
- Audit logs and compliance reporting

### The Difference

Unlike other approaches to AI safety that rely solely on training-time interventions or post-deployment monitoring, Promethios embeds governance directly into the runtime execution environment. This approach ensures that:

1. Governance cannot be bypassed
2. Reflection is enforced, not suggested
3. Memory persists across sessions
4. Trust is continuously verified
5. Compliance is guaranteed, not hoped for

Experience the only comprehensive governance solution for AI agents—because in a world of increasingly autonomous systems, governance isn't optional, it's essential.
