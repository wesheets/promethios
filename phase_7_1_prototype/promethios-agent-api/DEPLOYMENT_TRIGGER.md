# Deployment Trigger

This file is used to trigger backend deployment when CORS fixes need to be applied.

## Current CORS Configuration Status:

- ✅ CORS origins: "*" (all origins allowed)
- ✅ CORS methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
- ✅ CORS headers: Content-Type, Authorization, x-api-key, X-Requested-With
- ✅ Preflight handler: Explicit OPTIONS handling implemented
- ✅ Max age: 86400 seconds (24 hours)

## Expected Result:
Frontend should be able to make requests to backend with x-api-key header without CORS errors.
