- **Belief Trace Module**: Extend trace data to include confidence metadata
- **Enhanced Reflection Module**: Integrate confidence scoring into reflection processes
- **UI Components**: Create visualizations for confidence levels and evidence maps

### Dependencies
- Belief Trace Module (Phase 7.1)
- PRISM Observer (Phase 7.1)
- Enhanced Reflection Module (Phase 7.1)
- Constitutional Hooks Manager (Phase 7.1)

### Technical Requirements
- Schema for confidence levels and evidence relationships
- API for confidence calculation and retrieval
- Storage mechanism for evidence maps
- Performance optimization for real-time confidence scoring

## 2. Tool Selection History Module

### Core Requirements
- Track tool usage patterns across agent operations
- Analyze tool efficacy for different task types
- Provide recommendations for optimal tool selection
- Support learning from past tool selection outcomes
- Enable tool usage analytics and visualization

### Integration Points
