## Overview

This document summarizes the work done to implement and fix the guest human avatar display and persistence in the Promethios chat interface. The primary goal was to ensure that when a guest human is invited to a chat, their avatar appears correctly in the UI and their participation is properly tracked and persisted.




## Problem Description

The main issue was that guest human avatars were not appearing in the chat interface after being invited. The root cause was identified as a mismatch in conversation IDs between the `UnifiedParticipantService` (where participants are stored) and the `ChatHistoryService` (where they are retrieved). Specifically, participants were being stored with one conversation ID format (e.g., `session_abcdef`) but retrieved with a different format (e.g., `chat_abcdef`), causing the retrieval to fail.




## Solution

The solution involved several steps:

1.  **Debugging and Logging:** Added extensive logging to both the `UnifiedParticipantService` and `ChatHistoryService` to track the conversation IDs being used during participant storage and retrieval. This helped pinpoint the exact nature of the ID mismatch.

2.  **Bug Fix in `ChatHistoryService`:** Fixed a bug in the `mergeUnifiedParticipants` method where it was incorrectly trying to access a `participants` property on the array returned by `getConversationParticipants`.

3.  **Improved Alternative ID Logic:** Enhanced the `getConversationParticipants` method in `UnifiedParticipantService` to include more robust alternative ID matching. This now handles cases where conversation IDs have different prefixes (e.g., `chat_` vs. `session_`) by attempting to swap them during lookup.

4.  **Testing:** Created a dedicated test script (`test_participant_flow.js`) to simulate the guest invitation flow and verify that the conversation ID mismatch was resolved. The tests confirmed that the improved alternative ID logic correctly retrieves participants even when the storage and retrieval IDs have different prefixes.




## Conclusion

With these changes, the guest human avatar display and persistence issue is resolved. The system can now correctly track and display guest participants in the chat interface, ensuring a seamless user experience for collaborative chat sessions. The improved logging and testing also provide a more robust foundation for future development and debugging.
