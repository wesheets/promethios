## 🔍 **Monitoring & Testing**

### **Real-Time Monitoring**

#### **1. Firebase Console - Function Logs**
Monitor email delivery in real-time:
```
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/promethios/functions/logs
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ `📧 New waitlist submission received: [email]`
- ✅ `🗄️ Using promethios-oregon database (us-west1 region)`
- ✅ `📤 Sending email to: [email]`
- ✅ `✅ Email sent successfully: [messageId]`

#### **2. Firestore Database**
View new waitlist submissions:
```
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/promethios/firestore/databases/-default-/data
```

**Collections to monitor:**
- `waitlist` - New submissions with lead scoring data
- Look for documents with `leadScore`, `priority`, and `submissionId` fields

#### **3. Gmail Sent Folder**
Check your Gmail account's Sent folder to confirm emails are being delivered from `hello@promethios.ai`

### **Testing the System**

#### **Test 1: Submit Test Entry**
1. Go to your waitlist form
2. Submit a test entry with a different email address
3. Check Firebase logs within 30 seconds
4. Verify email delivery in Gmail Sent folder
5. Check recipient inbox for professional email

#### **Test 2: Monitor Function Performance**
```bash
# View recent function logs
firebase functions:log --only sendWaitlistEmail

# View function metrics
firebase functions:log --only sendWaitlistEmail --lines 50
```

#### **Test 3: Verify Lead Scoring**
- Submit entries with different roles (Enterprise CTO vs Other)
- Check that lead scores are calculated correctly
- Verify priority levels appear in email subjects

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Issue: No Email Received**
**Symptoms:** Waitlist submission successful, but no email sent

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Check Firebase Function logs for errors
2. Verify Gmail App Password is still valid
3. Check spam/junk folder in recipient email
4. Confirm Cloud Function is deployed: `firebase functions:list`

```bash
# Redeploy function if needed
cd /home/ubuntu/promethios/firebase-functions
firebase deploy --only functions:sendWaitlistEmail
```

#### **Issue: Function Timeout**
**Symptoms:** Function logs show timeout errors

**Solution:**
- Gmail SMTP may be slow - this is normal

- Check Gmail Sent folder - email may still be delivered

#### **Issue: Authentication Errors**
**Symptoms:** "Invalid login" or "Authentication failed" in logs

**Solution:**
```bash
# Update Gmail App Password
firebase functions:config:set email.pass="NEW-APP-PASSWORD"
firebase deploy --only functions:sendWaitlistEmail
```
