# Governance Activation Mechanisms by Wrapper Type

## Executive Summary

The Enhanced Emotional Veritas 2 governance system employs sophisticated activation mechanisms that adapt to different wrapper types while providing consistent governance capabilities. The system automatically detects wrapper configuration, operational context, and requirements to activate appropriate governance features seamlessly.

## 1. Single Agent Wrapper Activation

### 1.1 Activation Triggers

**Single Agent Wrapper Detection:**
```python
# System automatically detects single agent configuration
if wrapper_type == "single_agent":
    governance_mode = "individual_agent_governance"
    activation_strategy = "context_aware_individual"
```

**Key Activation Scenarios:**

1. **Uncertainty Detection**: When agent confidence drops below threshold
2. **Compliance Triggers**: When content involves regulated domains
3. **Quality Assurance**: When output quality metrics indicate issues
4. **User Request Complexity**: When requests exceed agent capability thresholds

### 1.2 Activation Levels

**Level 1 - Basic Governance:**
- Policy compliance monitoring
- Basic uncertainty detection
- Standard output validation
- Minimal collaborative features

**Level 2 - Enhanced Governance:**
- Quantum uncertainty modeling
- Human-agent collaboration
- Advanced compliance checking
- Predictive risk assessment

**Level 3 - Advanced Governance:**
- Full collaborative reflection
- Temporal reasoning
- Multidimensional analysis
- Emergent intelligence detection

### 1.3 Activation Flow

```
Request Input → Context Analysis → Risk Assessment → Activation Decision → Governance Execution
```

## 2. Multi-Agent Wrapper Activation

### 2.1 Distributed Activation Coordination

**Multi-Agent Network Detection:**
```python
# System detects multi-agent configuration
if wrapper_type == "multi_agent":
    governance_mode = "distributed_collective_governance"
    activation_strategy = "emergent_intelligence_optimization"
```

**Collective Activation Triggers:**

1. **Emergent Behavior Detection**: When agent interactions produce novel insights
2. **Distributed Uncertainty**: When multiple agents encounter related uncertainties
3. **Collective Problem-Solving**: When problems require multiple expertise domains
4. **Consensus Requirements**: When decisions need multi-agent validation

### 2.2 Network-Wide Activation Patterns

**Cascade Activation**: One agent's uncertainty triggers network-wide collaboration
**Parallel Activation**: Multiple agents simultaneously activate governance features
**Hierarchical Activation**: Lead agents coordinate governance across the network
**Emergent Activation**: Governance emerges from agent interactions

### 2.3 Collective Intelligence Orchestration

The system automatically forms optimal agent teams based on:
- Expertise requirements
- Uncertainty types
- Collaboration history
- Performance metrics

## 3. Context-Aware Activation Examples

### 3.1 Chat Scenario Activation

**Single Agent Chat:**
```
User: "I'm confused about this policy"
→ Uncertainty detected
→ Activate collaborative reflection
→ Agent: "Let me work through this with you step by step..."
```

**Multi-Agent Chat:**
```
User: "I need help with a complex technical decision"
→ Complexity analysis triggers multi-agent activation
→ Technical Agent: "Let me analyze the architecture"
→ Compliance Agent: "I'll check regulatory requirements"
→ Creative Agent: "Here are some innovative alternatives"
```

### 3.2 Code Development Activation

**Single Agent Code Review:**
```
Agent detects uncertain code pattern
→ Activate uncertainty collaboration
→ "I want to ensure this implementation is optimal. Let me explain my analysis and get your input on the approach..."
```

**Multi-Agent Code Development:**
```
Complex architecture decision needed
→ Activate specialist agent network
→ Architecture Agent + Security Agent + Performance Agent
→ Collaborative solution synthesis
```

### 3.3 Compliance Scenario Activation

**Single Agent Compliance:**
```
Regulatory content detected
→ Activate enhanced compliance mode
→ "This involves important compliance considerations. Let me work through this systematically with you..."
```

**Multi-Agent Compliance:**
```
Multi-jurisdictional compliance issue
→ Activate compliance specialist network
→ Regional compliance agents collaborate
→ Comprehensive compliance solution
```

## 4. Activation Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Single Agent | Multi-Agent | Activation Level |
|----------|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| Simple Query | Basic | N/A | Level 1 |
| Uncertain Response | Enhanced | Collaborative | Level 2 |
| Complex Problem | Advanced | Emergent Intelligence | Level 3 |
| Compliance Issue | Enhanced | Specialist Network | Level 2-3 |
| Creative Task | Enhanced | Creative Swarm | Level 2-3 |

## 5. Performance Optimization

## 6. Integration Benefits

### 6.1 Seamless Operation

- **Zero Configuration**: Automatic wrapper type detection
- **Transparent Activation**: Users experience enhanced capabilities without complexity
- **Consistent Interface**: Same governance benefits regardless of wrapper type
- **Optimal Performance**: Resources allocated efficiently based on actual needs

### 6.2 Enhanced Capabilities

- **Single Agents**: Transform uncertainty into collaboration opportunities
