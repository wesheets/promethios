## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive test plan for the new UI modules and features developed for the Promethios platform. The goal is to ensure high quality, reliability, and adherence to requirements for all implemented functionalities, including the extension system, advanced AI governance features, navigation, and various utility modules.

## 2. Scope of Testing

-   **Core Extension System**: Registration, lifecycle, feature toggles.
-   **Navigation**: Left navigation integration, new Header navigation, full-width layout responsiveness.
-   **Agent Wrapping & Observer**: Core functionality, multi-agent capabilities, observer UI (hovering bubble).
-   **Chat Interfaces**: Single-agent, multi-agent, toggleable modes, document upload, UI layout.
-   **Governance Modules**:
