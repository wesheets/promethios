# Phase 5.11: Minimal Viable Governance - Implementation Documentation

## Overview

The Minimal Viable Governance (MVG) framework provides a comprehensive governance solution for the Promethios system. This phase implements the core governance primitives, decision framework, policy management, and requirement validation components that form the foundation of the governance system.

## Architecture

The MVG framework consists of four primary components:

1. **Governance Primitive Manager**: Manages the fundamental building blocks of governance, including constraints, rules, directives, controls, and standards.

2. **Decision Framework Engine**: Provides a flexible decision-making framework with multiple decision models, including consensus, majority, supermajority, unanimous, weighted, and hierarchical voting.

3. **Policy Management Module**: Manages governance policies, including creation, validation, enforcement, and exemption handling.

4. **Requirement Validation Module**: Validates system components against governance requirements, ensuring compliance with established standards.

## Component Details

### Governance Primitive Manager

The Governance Primitive Manager (`GovernancePrimitiveManager`) provides functionality for creating, managing, and validating governance primitives. These primitives serve as the fundamental building blocks of the governance system.

Key features:
- Creation and management of governance primitives
- Validation against JSON schema
- Lifecycle management (draft, active, deprecated, archived)
- Rule evaluation for compliance checking
- Event recording and handling

### Decision Framework Engine

The Decision Framework Engine (`DecisionFrameworkEngine`) provides a flexible framework for making governance decisions. It supports multiple decision models and voting mechanisms.

Key features:
- Multiple decision models (consensus, majority, supermajority, etc.)
- Vote casting and tracking
- Automatic decision finalization based on voting results
- Manual decision finalization for administrative override
- Event recording and handling

### Policy Management Module

The Policy Management Module (`PolicyManagementModule`) manages governance policies, including creation, validation, enforcement, and exemption handling.

Key features:
- Policy creation and management
- Policy validation against JSON schema
- Policy enforcement through rule evaluation
- Exemption handling for special cases
- Event recording and handling

### Requirement Validation Module

The Requirement Validation Module (`RequirementValidationModule`) validates system components against governance requirements, ensuring compliance with established standards.

Key features:
- Requirement creation and management
- Validation of components against requirements
- Compliance reporting and tracking
- Integration with attestation services
- Event recording and handling

## Integration Points

The MVG framework integrates with several existing components:

1. **Codex Lock (Phase 5.8)**: All governance modules verify tether to Codex contracts and operation tethers for critical operations.

2. **Trust Decay Engine (Phase 5.9)**: The governance modules use trust metrics for decision-making and policy enforcement.

3. **Attestation Service (Phase 5.10)**: The governance modules use attestations for validation and compliance checking.

## Security Considerations

The MVG framework includes several security features:

1. **Codex Contract Tethering**: All modules verify tether to Codex contracts to ensure integrity.

2. **Operation Tethering**: Critical operations verify operation tethers to prevent unauthorized actions.

3. **Immutable Audit Trails**: All governance events are recorded in immutable audit trails.

4. **Cryptographic Verification**: Attestations and signatures are cryptographically verified.

5. **Trust-Based Access Control**: Access to governance functions is controlled based on trust metrics.

## Compliance

The MVG framework ensures compliance with governance requirements through:

1. **Schema Validation**: All governance objects are validated against JSON schemas.

2. **Rule Evaluation**: Governance rules are evaluated to ensure compliance.

3. **Attestation Verification**: Attestations are verified to ensure authenticity.

4. **Trust Metrics**: Trust metrics are used to ensure entities meet minimum trust requirements.

5. **Audit Trails**: All governance actions are recorded in audit trails for compliance verification.

## Testing

The MVG framework includes comprehensive testing:

1. **Unit Tests**: Each module includes unit tests for all public methods.

2. **Integration Tests**: Integration tests verify the interaction between modules.

3. **End-to-End Tests**: End-to-end tests verify the complete governance workflow.

4. **Performance Tests**: Performance tests ensure the governance system can handle expected load.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the MVG framework include:

1. **Advanced Decision Models**: Additional decision models for more complex governance scenarios.

2. **Policy Templates**: Pre-defined policy templates for common governance scenarios.

3. **Requirement Libraries**: Libraries of common governance requirements.

4. **Governance Analytics**: Advanced analytics for governance metrics and trends.

5. **Governance Dashboards**: Visual dashboards for governance status and compliance.

## Conclusion

The Minimal Viable Governance framework provides a comprehensive foundation for governance in the Promethios system. It enables the creation, management, and enforcement of governance primitives, decisions, policies, and requirements, ensuring the system operates within established governance boundaries.
