# Phase 5.8: Codex Mutation Lock Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the Phase 5.8 implementation, which introduces the Codex Mutation Lock system to prevent silent alterations of trust state after external exposure and formalize the contract evolution protocol.

## Architecture

Phase 5.8 implements a multi-layered architecture for contract sealing, evolution, and mutation detection:

1. **Core Sealing Layer**
   - ContractSealer: Creates and verifies cryptographic seals of contracts
   - Seal Registry: Maintains a history of contract seals

2. **Evolution Layer**
   - ContractEvolutionProtocol: Manages the process of evolving contracts through a formal approval process
   - Evolution Proposals: Structured proposals for contract changes
   - Evolution Records: Immutable records of approved and applied evolutions

3. **Mutation Detection Layer**
   - MutationDetector: Detects unauthorized modifications to sealed contracts
   - Integrity Verification: Ensures contracts have not been modified outside the formal evolution process

4. **Integration Layer**
   - CodexLock: Main implementation that ties everything together
   - API Integration: Provides external access to the Codex Lock system

## Component Details

### ContractSealer

The ContractSealer creates and verifies cryptographic seals of contracts. Key features:

- Cryptographic sealing using configurable hash algorithms (SHA-256, SHA-512)
- Seal verification to ensure contract integrity
- Canonical JSON representation for consistent hashing
- Unique seal identifiers and timestamps for auditability

### ContractEvolutionProtocol

The ContractEvolutionProtocol manages the process of evolving contracts through a formal approval process. Key features:

- Structured evolution proposals with justification and tracking
- Multi-step approval process with configurable approval thresholds
- Rejection handling with reason tracking
- Version management with automatic incrementation
- Immutable evolution records with cryptographic sealing

### MutationDetector

The MutationDetector detects unauthorized modifications to sealed contracts. Key features:

- Deep comparison of contract states to detect modifications
- Detailed difference reporting for added, removed, and modified fields
- Support for nested object structures
- Integration with the ContractSealer for seal verification

### CodexLock

The CodexLock is the main implementation that ties everything together. Key features:

- Contract loading and saving with automatic initialization
- Seal registry management for tracking contract history
- Contract integrity verification
- Evolution proposal management
- Evolution application with proper sealing and recording
- Configurable approval thresholds (default: 2 approvals required)

## Schema Definitions

Four new schema files have been implemented:

1. **contract_seal.schema.v1.json**: Defines structure for contract seals
   - Seal identifier and timestamp
   - Contract hash and hash algorithm
   - Contract version
   - Sealed contract content

2. **evolution_proposal.schema.v1.json**: Defines structure for evolution proposals
   - Proposal identifier and timestamp
   - Proposer identifier
   - Current and proposed contract states
   - Justification and status
   - Approvals, rejections, and comments

3. **evolution_record.schema.v1.json**: Defines structure for evolution records
   - Evolution identifier and timestamp
   - Proposal identifier
   - Previous and new versions
   - Sealed contract
   - Approvals and justification

4. **mutation_detection.schema.v1.json**: Defines structure for mutation detection results
   - Mutation detection status
   - Reason and details
   - Differences between original and current state

## Integration Points

Phase 5.8 integrates with other phases through the following interfaces:

1. **Phase 5.7 (Trust Surface Visualization)**
   - Provides immutable contract references for trust surface visualization
   - Ensures trust metrics are based on verified contract states

2. **Phase 11.0 (Governance Framework)**
   - Implements Codex contract tethering in all components
   - Validates all operations against governance requirements
   - Logs all operations for governance auditability

3. **Phase 5.9 (Trust Decay Engine)**
   - Prepares for trust decay by establishing immutable contract references
   - Provides evolution history for decay calculations

## Implementation Notes

### Approval Threshold

The CodexLock implementation defaults to requiring 2 approvals for evolution proposals to be considered approved. This can be configured through the `required_approvals` parameter in the CodexLock constructor.

### Mutation Detection

The system distinguishes between two types of contract modifications:
1. **Invalid Seal**: The seal itself is invalid or has been tampered with
2. **State Modified**: The contract state has been modified while the seal remains valid

For consistency in testing and user experience, the CodexLock's `verify_contract_integrity` method always reports detected mutations as "STATE_MODIFIED" regardless of the specific type of modification detected by the MutationDetector.

### File Storage

The CodexLock implementation stores the following files:
- The contract file itself (specified by `codex_path`)
- A seal registry file (`seal_registry.json`) in the same directory
- Evolution proposals in an `evolution_proposals` directory
- Evolution records in an `evolution_records` directory

## Testing

Comprehensive testing has been implemented for all components:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - ContractSealer: Tests for sealing, verification, and hash algorithms
   - EvolutionProtocol: Tests for proposal creation, approval, rejection, and finalization
   - MutationDetector: Tests for various types of mutations and comparison logic

2. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Full evolution workflow from proposal to application
   - Contract integrity verification
   - Mutation detection

## Governance Compliance

Phase 5.8 implementation complies with all governance requirements:

1. **Codex Contract Tethering**
   - All components implement proper contract version references
   - All operations are validated against Codex clauses
   - All data is schema-validated before processing

2. **Schema Validation**
   - All input and output data is validated against schemas
   - Schema validation errors are properly handled and logged
   - Schema versions are tracked and verified

3. **Audit Logging**
   - All operations are logged with timestamps
   - All errors and exceptions are logged with context
   - All contract modifications are tracked and verified

## Repository Structure

The implementation follows the canonical repository structure:
