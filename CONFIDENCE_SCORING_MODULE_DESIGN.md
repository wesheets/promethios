# Confidence Scoring Module Design

## Overview
The Confidence Scoring module provides transparency into agent decision-making by calculating confidence levels for agent outputs and creating evidence maps that link decisions to supporting data. This module transforms Promethios from a black box to a transparent reasoning system, giving users insight into not just what the agent believes, but how strongly and why.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Confidence Calculator**
   - Calculates confidence scores based on evidence quality and quantity
   - Supports multiple calculation algorithms (Bayesian, weighted average, etc.)
   - Provides confidence intervals and uncertainty metrics

2. **Evidence Mapper**
   - Creates structured maps linking decisions to supporting evidence
   - Tracks evidence provenance and quality metrics
   - Supports hierarchical evidence relationships

3. **Confidence Analytics**
   - Tracks confidence patterns across agent operations
   - Identifies areas of consistent low/high confidence
   - Provides insights for agent improvement

4. **Confidence Visualization Manager**
   - Prepares confidence data for UI visualization
   - Supports multiple visualization formats
   - Handles real-time confidence updates

### Integration Points

1. **PRISM Observer Integration**
   - Connects to belief trace verification for evidence validation
   - Receives verification results to adjust confidence scores
   - Provides confidence metadata for governance monitoring

2. **Belief Trace Module Integration**
   - Extends trace data to include confidence metadata
   - Links evidence to source traces
   - Ensures trace verification impacts confidence scores

3. **Enhanced Reflection Module Integration**
   - Incorporates confidence scoring into reflection processes
   - Uses reflection outcomes to refine confidence calculations
   - Provides confidence context for reflection operations

4. **Constitutional Hooks Integration**
   - Registers hooks for confidence-related events
   - Triggers confidence calculations on relevant system events
   - Enables passive monitoring of confidence patterns

## Data Structures

    lower: number;
    upper: number;
  };

```typescript
interface EvidenceItem {
  id: string;                 // Unique identifier
  type: string;               // Type of evidence (source, inference, etc.)
  content: any;               // The actual evidence content
  weight: number;             // Contribution to confidence score
  quality: number;            // Quality assessment (0.0 to 1.0)
  traceId?: string;           // Optional link to belief trace
  timestamp: number;          // When the evidence was collected
  metadata: Record<string, any>; // Additional context
}
```

### Evidence Map
```typescript
interface EvidenceMap {
  id: string;                 // Unique identifier
  decisionId: string;         // ID of the decision being supported
  rootEvidence: EvidenceItem[]; // Top-level evidence items
  relationships: {            // Hierarchical relationships
    parentId: string;
    childId: string;
    relationshipType: string;
  }[];
  confidenceScore: ConfidenceScore; // Overall confidence
  timestamp: number;          // When the map was created/updated
  metadata: Record<string, any>; // Additional context
}
```

### Confidence Threshold Configuration
```typescript
interface ConfidenceThresholds {
  critical: number;           // Threshold for critical operations
  standard: number;           // Threshold for standard operations
  informational: number;      // Threshold for informational outputs
  customThresholds: {         // Domain-specific thresholds
    domain: string;
    value: number;
  }[];
}
```

## API Design

### Confidence Calculator API
```typescript
interface ConfidenceCalculatorAPI {
  calculateConfidence(evidenceItems: EvidenceItem[], options?: CalculationOptions): ConfidenceScore;
  updateConfidence(existingScore: ConfidenceScore, newEvidence: EvidenceItem[]): ConfidenceScore;
  compareConfidence(score1: ConfidenceScore, score2: ConfidenceScore): ComparisonResult;
  getConfidenceThresholds(): ConfidenceThresholds;
  setConfidenceThresholds(thresholds: ConfidenceThresholds): void;
}
```

### Evidence Mapper API
```typescript
interface EvidenceMapperAPI {
  createEvidenceMap(decisionId: string, evidenceItems: EvidenceItem[]): EvidenceMap;
  addEvidence(mapId: string, evidence: EvidenceItem, parentId?: string): EvidenceMap;
  removeEvidence(mapId: string, evidenceId: string): EvidenceMap;
  getEvidenceMap(mapId: string): EvidenceMap;
  listEvidenceMaps(filters?: MapFilters): EvidenceMap[];
}
```

## Workflow

### Confidence Calculation Workflow
1. Agent generates an output (decision, belief, etc.)
2. Evidence collection is triggered
3. Evidence is validated through PRISM and Belief Trace
4. Confidence Calculator computes score based on evidence
5. Evidence Map is created linking decision to supporting evidence
6. Confidence score and evidence map are attached to the output
7. Analytics are updated with new confidence data
8. Visualization data is prepared for UI components

### Confidence Threshold Workflow
1. Confidence thresholds are configured based on operation criticality
2. Agent output is generated with confidence score
3. Score is compared against relevant threshold
4. If below threshold, additional evidence collection is triggered
5. If still below threshold, user is notified of low confidence
6. Analytics track threshold violations for pattern identification

### Evidence Update Workflow
1. New evidence becomes available for existing decision
2. Evidence is validated and weighted
3. Evidence Map is updated with new evidence
4. Confidence score is recalculated
5. Updated confidence and evidence map are published
6. Analytics are updated with confidence change data
