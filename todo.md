# Multi-Agent Wrapper Wiring Issues - TODO

## Analysis Phase 1: Current State
- [x] Examined repository structure
- [x] Found MultiAgentWrapper.tsx component in ui/multi-agent-wrapper/
- [x] Found MultiAgentPage.tsx in ui/pages/
- [x] Found AgentWrapper.tsx in ui/agent-wrapper/
- [x] Examined routing in ui/routes/AppRoutes.tsx
- [x] Found backend API routes in src/api/agents/ and src/api/multi_agent/
- [x] Found main API server configuration in src/api_server.py

## Identified Issues

### Missing Routes
- [ ] Routes for `/ui/agents/multi-wrapping` not defined in AppRoutes.tsx
- [ ] Routes for `/ui/agents/profiles` not defined in AppRoutes.tsx
- [ ] Current routes only have `/multi-agent` but not the specific agent workflow paths

### Component Integration Issues
- [ ] MultiAgentWrapper component exists but may not be properly integrated into routing
- [ ] AgentWrapper component exists but routing may be missing
- [ ] Need to verify if agent profiles component exists

### Backend Integration
- [ ] Verify API endpoints are properly connected to frontend
- [ ] Check if API calls in components are working
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling and loading states

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Frontend Component Analysis
- [x] Examined all agent-related components
- [x] Found ProfileSelector component in ui/governance/ProfileSelector.tsx
- [x] Found AgentContext for state management
- [x] Found MainLayout with navigation structure
- [x] Identified missing navigation items for agent workflows

#### Key Findings:
- ProfileSelector exists but not properly integrated into routing
- AgentContext provides state management for wrapped agents
- MainLayout has basic navigation but missing specific agent workflow paths
- Navigation includes '/agents' and '/multi-agent' but not the specific paths from screenshot

### Phase 3: Backend API Analysis  
- [x] Review complete API endpoint structure
- [x] Found comprehensive agent routes in src/api/agents/routes.py
- [x] Found multi-agent coordination routes in src/api/multi_agent/routes.py
- [x] Found multi-agent system routes in src/api/multi_agent_system/routes.py
- [x] Identified API server configuration in src/api_server.py

#### Key Findings:
- Backend has extensive API endpoints for agent management
- Multi-agent coordination APIs exist with proper models
- API server includes CORS middleware for frontend integration
- Routes are properly registered in main API server
- API server may have import/dependency issues preventing startup
- [ ] Verify data flow between frontend and backend

### Phase 4: Identify gaps and issues in frontend-backend integration
- [x] Analyzed routing gaps and missing route definitions
- [x] Identified component integration issues  
- [x] Found navigation structure problems
- [x] Documented API integration issues
- [x] Created detailed analysis in integration_issues_analysis.md

#### Critical Issues Found:
1. **Missing Routes**: `/ui/agents/multi-wrapping` and `/ui/agents/profiles` not defined
2. **Component Isolation**: Components exist but not properly wired to routing
3. **Navigation Gaps**: MainLayout missing agent workflow navigation
4. **API Integration**: Frontend-backend connection issues
5. **Workflow Continuity**: No proper flow between workflow steps
- [ ] Wire components to proper API endpoints
- [ ] Fix any broken API calls
- [ ] Ensure proper navigation between workflows

### Phase 5: Testing
- [ ] Test both workflows end-to-end
- [ ] Verify all steps in multi-agent wrapper process work
- [ ] Test navigation between different agent pages

### Phase 6: Documentation
- [ ] Document the fixed workflows
- [ ] Create integration guide
