- Current UI is cramped and not attention-grabbing
- Responses are somewhat scripted, need better AI integration
- Need larger expandable window that doesn't affect navigation
- Need pulsing effects and bump-out animations
- Need comprehensive Promethios knowledge injection

## Phase 2: Design Enhanced UI ✅

- [x] Create responsive design for right-side expansion
- [x] Plan separation from navigation collapse
- [x] Design improved chat interface
- [x] Create SuperEnhancedObserverAgent component
- [x] Create SuperEnhancedObserverButton component

**DESIGN ACHIEVEMENTS:**
- Created 900x800px expandable window (much larger than 400px original)

## Phase 3: Implement Pulsing Effects ✅
- [x] Add attention-grabbing pulsing animation
- [x] Implement bump-out effect to the right
- [x] Create visual indicators for user engagement
