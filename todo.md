- [ ] Plan real-time communication architecture
- [ ] Define governance toggle functionality
- [ ] Design metrics dashboard layout
- [ ] Plan rich input interface with file uploads
- [ ] Define WebSocket/real-time communication strategy
- [ ] Create component hierarchy and data flow

### Phase 2: Create Multi-Agent Collaboration Display Component
- [ ] Build agent status cards showing thinking/working state
- [ ] Implement real-time agent communication display
- [ ] Add agent-to-agent message visualization
- [ ] Create collaborative vs individual work modes
- [ ] Add agent role indicators and capabilities

### Phase 3: Build Rich User Input Interface with File Upload
- [ ] Create comprehensive prompt input box
- [ ] Implement file upload for documents, images, videos
- [ ] Add internet link input and validation
- [ ] Support multi-modal input types
- [ ] Add input type indicators and previews

### Phase 4: Implement Real-Time Metrics Dashboard
- [ ] Create governance metrics display
- [ ] Add trust score and compliance tracking
- [ ] Implement performance metrics (response time, accuracy)
- [ ] Build comparative analysis (governed vs ungoverned)
- [ ] Add real-time metric updates

### Phase 5: Add Governance Toggle and Comparison Features
- [ ] Implement governed vs ungoverned toggle
- [ ] Create side-by-side comparison view
- [ ] Add governance decision explanations
- [ ] Show cryptographic seal verification
- [ ] Display policy compliance indicators

### Phase 6: Integrate with CMU Benchmark Backend Services
- [ ] Connect to real CMU benchmark service
- [ ] Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
- [ ] Add file upload backend processing
- [ ] Integrate with governance API endpoints
- [ ] Handle multi-agent coordination backend

### Phase 7: Test and Deploy Complete Chat Interface
- [ ] Test multi-agent collaboration scenarios
- [ ] Verify governance toggle functionality
- [ ] Test file upload and processing
- [ ] Validate real-time metrics accuracy
- [ ] Deploy to production environment
