# Promethios CMU Benchmark Real Agent Implementation

## Phase 2: Create Real Agent API Service Layer

### âœ… Analysis Complete
- [x] Examined current CMU benchmark UI implementation (mocked agents)
- [x] Reviewed API benchmark routes (has LLM service foundation)
- [x] Identified LLM service with real API integrations

### ðŸ”„ Current Phase: Create Real Agent API Service Layer
- [ ] Create chat endpoint for real agent conversations
- [ ] Implement governance toggle functionality in API
- [ ] Add Promethios governance integration for governed mode
- [ ] Create agent response service with real LLM calls
- [ ] Add proper error handling and response formatting
- [ ] Test API endpoints with real LLM providers

### ðŸ“‹ Next Phases
- [ ] Phase 3: Convert mock agents to real agents in UI
- [ ] Phase 4: Implement working chat interface
- [ ] Phase 5: Test and validate end-to-end system
- [ ] Phase 6: Deploy and deliver working demo system

## Current Status
- âœ… Core kernel: 561/561 tests passing
- âœ… API deployed successfully at: https://promethios-phase-7-1-api.onrender.com
- âœ… LLM service configured with OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, HuggingFace
- ðŸ”„ Converting mock agents to real API-connected agents

## Key Requirements
1. Real LLM API calls (not mocked responses)
2. Governance toggle that actually routes through Promethios governance
3. Working chat interface with conversation persistence
4. Real metrics and trust scores from governance system
5. End-to-end validation of governed vs ungoverned modes
