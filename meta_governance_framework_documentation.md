# Meta-Governance Framework Documentation

## Overview

The Meta-Governance Framework provides a comprehensive solution for reflective and adaptive governance over the Promethios system. This framework integrates with all previous phases of the Promethios project, enabling continuous monitoring, adaptation, and recovery of governance operations.

## Architecture

The Meta-Governance Framework consists of six core components:

1. **Meta-Governance Manager**: Central coordinator for all meta-governance operations
2. **Reflection Loop Tracker**: Tracks and analyzes governance decision-making processes
3. **Governance State Monitor**: Continuously monitors the state of governance components
4. **Policy Adaptation Engine**: Enables dynamic adjustment of governance policies
5. **Compliance Verification System**: Verifies compliance with regulatory and organizational requirements
6. **Recovery Trigger System**: Detects governance failures and triggers recovery mechanisms
