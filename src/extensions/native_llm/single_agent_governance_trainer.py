Comprehensive Single-Agent Governance Training Pipeline
Focuses on individual agent governance capabilities

This module trains native LLM agents with built-in governance that can:
- Make trust-aware decisions independently
- Interpret and apply policies at the individual level
- Self-regulate using emotional intelligence
- Detect and prevent hallucinations
- Provide governance-compliant responses
- Justify decisions using governance frameworks
