Monitoring Event Behavior Adapter for Promethios.

This module implements versioned behaviors for monitoring event generation,
supporting both pre-6.4 and 6.4.0 behaviors as documented in
constitutional amendment CGF-2025-03.

Pre-6.4: 2 events generated during recovery operations
6.4.0: 4 events generated during recovery operations for enhanced observability
