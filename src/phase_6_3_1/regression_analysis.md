# Regression Analysis Report

## Overview
After implementing fixes for the synchronization issue between propagation and verification components, we've encountered a significant regression. The number of failing tests has increased from 1 to 9, indicating that our changes have introduced new issues in the Trust Verification System.

## Identified Issues

### 1. Synchronization Timing Problem
- The synchronization step added to `verify_trust_level` and `enforce_trust_boundary` methods is causing attribute values to be reset or overwritten
- The `synchronize_attributes` method may be creating a new set of attributes that don't preserve the original trust scores

### 2. Inheritance Chain Verification
- The verification of inheritance chains is failing across multiple tests
- The added verification step in `register_inheritance_relationship` may be too strict, causing valid relationships to fail

### 3. Trust Score Validation
- Tests expecting specific trust scores are failing with scores of 0.0
- This suggests that attribute recalculation is resetting scores instead of preserving them

## Root Causes

1. **Attribute Overwriting**: The synchronization process is creating new attributes with default values instead of preserving existing values
   
2. **Circular Dependencies**: The added verification step in `register_inheritance_relationship` creates a circular dependency:
   - Registration calls verification
   - Verification requires synchronization
   - Synchronization may reset attributes
   - This leads to verification failure

3. **Recalculation Logic**: The `_recalculate_attributes` method in the propagation manager may be resetting scores when called after synchronization

## Next Steps

1. Remove the verification step from `register_inheritance_relationship` to break the circular dependency
2. Modify the synchronization method to preserve existing attribute values
3. Ensure attribute recalculation preserves base scores unless explicitly changed
4. Add defensive checks to prevent attribute resets during synchronization

This analysis will guide our targeted repairs to resolve both the original synchronization issue and the new regressions without introducing further problems.
