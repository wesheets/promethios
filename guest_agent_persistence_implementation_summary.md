# Guest Agent Persistence Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented multi-agent chat persistence and session-specific agent management to ensure guest agents persist in chat history and only appear in the avatar bar for sessions they were added to.

## Changes Made

### 1. ChatHistoryService.ts Updates
- **Added participants field initialization** in `createChatSession()` to properly initialize host and guest participants
- **Added guest agent management methods**:
  - `addGuestAgentToSession()` - Adds a guest agent to a chat session
  - `removeGuestAgentFromSession()` - Removes a guest agent from a chat session  
  - `getGuestAgentsForSession()` - Retrieves guest agents for a chat session
- **Updated serialization/deserialization** to properly handle participants with Date objects
- **Added fallback logic** for sessions without participants field (backward compatibility)

### 2. ChatbotProfilesPageEnhanced.tsx Updates
- **Enhanced handleAddGuests()** to persist guest agents to chat sessions using the new ChatHistoryService methods
- **Updated onChatSelect()** to restore guest agents from chat sessions when loading a chat
- **Added state cleanup** when switching between chatbots to ensure guest agents are session-specific
- **Integrated guest agent restoration** with multiChatState and selectedAgents/targetAgents

## Implementation Details

### Guest Agent Persistence Flow
1. **Adding Guest Agents**: When users add guest agents via the avatar selector, they are:
   - Added to the multiChatState for immediate UI updates
   - Persisted to the current chat session via `addGuestAgentToSession()`
   - Added to selectedAgents and targetAgents arrays

2. **Loading Chat Sessions**: When users select a chat from history:
   - Guest agents are retrieved from the chat session via `getGuestAgentsForSession()`
   - Guest agents are restored to the multiChatState
   - selectedAgents and targetAgents are updated to include restored guest agents

3. **Session Isolation**: When switching between different chatbots:
   - Guest agents are cleared from multiChatState
   - selectedAgents and targetAgents are reset
   - This ensures guest agents are session-specific

### Data Structure
The ChatSession interface now properly initializes and manages participants:

```typescript
participants: {
  host: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    type: 'ai_agent';
    joinedAt: Date;
    messageCount: number;
    lastActive: Date;
    avatar?: string;
  },
  guests: ChatParticipant[] // Array of guest agents
}
```

## Benefits
1. **Persistence**: Guest agents now persist across browser sessions and chat reloads
2. **Session Isolation**: Guest agents only appear in the sessions where they were originally added
3. **Consistency**: Avatar bar accurately reflects which agents belong to each session
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing sessions without participants field are handled gracefully

## Testing Recommendations
1. Add guest agents to a chat session
2. Switch to a different chat session and verify guest agents don't appear
3. Return to the original session and verify guest agents are restored
4. Refresh the browser and verify guest agents persist
5. Test with multiple different chat sessions to ensure proper isolation
