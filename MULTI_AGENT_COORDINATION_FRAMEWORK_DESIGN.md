# Multi-Agent Coordination Framework Design Document

## Overview

The Multi-Agent Coordination Framework (MACF) for Phase 7.4 of the Promethios project enables multiple agents to work together with defined roles, communication protocols, and coordination mechanisms. This framework extends Promethios' capabilities to multi-agent scenarios while maintaining constitutional compliance and governance identity requirements.

## Core Requirements

1. **Agent Coordination Protocol**
   - Define standardized communication formats between agents
   - Establish role-based coordination patterns
   - Implement task delegation and result aggregation mechanisms
   - Support synchronous and asynchronous coordination modes

2. **Governance Identity Integration**
   - Enable governance identity exchange between agents
   - Implement trust negotiation based on governance compatibility
   - Visualize governance identity interactions in real-time
   - Provide constitutional compatibility assessment

3. **Adaptive Coordination**
   - Leverage the Adaptive Learning Loop for coordination optimization
   - Enable agents to learn effective coordination patterns
   - Implement feedback mechanisms for coordination quality

4. **Constitutional Compliance**
   - Ensure all coordination adheres to constitutional requirements
   - Maintain belief trace integrity across agent boundaries
   - Implement dispute resolution for constitutional conflicts

5. **CMU Benchmark Integration**
   - Support integration with external agents from CMU benchmark
   - Demonstrate governance identity exchange with external agents
   - Visualize trust boundaries and negotiation processes

## Architecture

The Multi-Agent Coordination Framework consists of the following components:

### 1. Coordination Manager
Central component responsible for orchestrating agent interactions, managing coordination lifecycle, and enforcing coordination policies.

### 2. Agent Registry
Maintains information about available agents, their capabilities, governance identities, and trust relationships.

### 3. Message Bus
Provides reliable message exchange between agents with support for different communication patterns (request-response, publish-subscribe, etc.).

### 4. Role Manager
Defines and enforces agent roles, permissions, and responsibilities within coordination contexts.

### 5. Task Allocator
Optimizes task distribution among agents based on capabilities, load, and performance history.

### 6. Governance Identity Exchange Protocol
Enables agents to exchange and verify governance identities when establishing coordination relationships.

### 7. Trust Negotiation Visualizer
Dashboard showing real-time trust negotiation between agents with different governance identities.

### 8. Constitutional Compatibility Assessor
Evaluates compatibility between agents with different constitutional frameworks.

### 9. Dispute Resolution Mechanism
Resolves conflicts when agents with different governance frameworks interact.

## Integration Points

### Governance Identity System
- Extend governance identity to include coordination capabilities and preferences
- Implement governance identity exchange protocol
- Develop trust negotiation based on governance compatibility

### Adaptive Learning Loop
- Collect feedback on coordination effectiveness
- Recognize patterns in successful coordination strategies
- Generate adaptations to improve coordination efficiency

### Constitutional Observers
- Extend PRISM to verify belief trace across agent boundaries
- Enhance VIGIL to monitor trust in multi-agent contexts
- Implement cross-agent constitutional enforcement

### Tool Selection History
- Track tool usage patterns across coordinated agents
- Optimize tool selection based on multi-agent context

## Governance Identity Interaction

The framework will include a dedicated module for governance identity interaction with the following features:

1. **Governance Identity Exchange Protocol**
   - Standardized format for governance identity exchange
   - Cryptographic verification of governance claims
   - Privacy-preserving identity disclosure mechanisms

2. **Trust Negotiation Visualization**
   - Real-time visualization of trust establishment
   - Interactive trust boundary adjustment
   - Historical trust negotiation analytics

3. **Constitutional Compatibility Assessment**
   - Automated compatibility scoring between constitutions
   - Identification of potential constitutional conflicts
   - Compatibility enhancement recommendations

4. **Adaptive Trust Boundaries**
   - Dynamic trust adjustment based on interaction history
   - Context-sensitive trust thresholds
   - Learning-based trust optimization

5. **Dispute Resolution Mechanism**
   - Structured conflict resolution protocol
   - Constitutional arbitration process
   - Audit trail for resolution decisions

## Implementation Plan

1. **Foundation Phase**
   - Implement core coordination protocol
   - Develop agent registry and message bus
   - Create basic role and task allocation mechanisms

2. **Governance Integration Phase**
   - Implement governance identity exchange protocol
   - Develop trust negotiation mechanisms
   - Create constitutional compatibility assessment

3. **Visualization Phase**
   - Develop trust negotiation dashboard
   - Implement coordination visualization
   - Create governance identity interaction displays

4. **Adaptive Integration Phase**
   - Connect with Adaptive Learning Loop
   - Implement coordination pattern recognition
   - Develop adaptive coordination strategies

5. **Testing and Validation Phase**
   - Develop comprehensive test suite
   - Validate with CMU benchmark agents
   - Ensure constitutional compliance

## Success Criteria

1. Multiple agents can coordinate effectively while maintaining constitutional compliance
2. Governance identities are exchanged and verified during coordination establishment
3. Trust negotiation is visualized and adaptively optimized
4. Constitutional compatibility is assessed and conflicts are resolved
5. The framework integrates successfully with CMU benchmark agents
6. All coordination activities maintain belief trace integrity and trust assessment

## Conclusion

The Multi-Agent Coordination Framework extends Promethios to support complex multi-agent scenarios while maintaining constitutional governance. By integrating governance identity exchange, trust negotiation visualization, and adaptive coordination, the framework enables safe and effective collaboration between agents with different governance models.
