By breaking Phase 7 into sub-phases (7.1, 7.2, 7.3), we create a clear implementation path for these new components while maintaining alignment with the overall roadmap.

Each module and observer includes corresponding UI/UX elements to ensure a complete user experience, and the implementation approach continues to follow the governance-first principles that have guided Promethios from the beginning. This roadmap provides a clear path to realizing the full potential of Promethios as the definitive governance framework for AI systems.
