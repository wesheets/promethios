Boundary Integrity Verifier Module

This module provides functionality for verifying the integrity of trust boundaries
and detecting violations. It serves as a dependency for the Governance Visualization framework.

Note: This is a stub implementation to support the Governance Visualization framework.
A complete implementation will be provided in a future phase.
