## Extension Strategies

### Strategy 1: Directory-Based Extensions
New functionality is implemented in dedicated directories that clearly indicate their purpose and phase relationship. This approach maintains separation of concerns while allowing for clear traceability.

**Example**: Phase 7.0's automated agent wrapping will extend `src/governance_wrapping/` with new files rather than modifying existing ones.

### Strategy 2: Interface-Based Extensions
New components implement established interfaces, ensuring compatibility with existing systems while allowing for enhanced functionality.

**Example**: Phase 8.0's adaptive governance will implement the same interfaces as Phase 7.5's governance hierarchy, ensuring backward compatibility.

### Strategy 3: Composition Over Inheritance
New features compose existing components rather than inheriting from them, reducing tight coupling and allowing for more flexible extension.

**Example**: Phase 8.5's role framework will compose Phase 7.5's governance hierarchy rather than inheriting from it.

### Strategy 4: Feature Flagging
New features are implemented behind feature flags, allowing for gradual rollout and easy rollback if needed.

**Example**: Phase 9.0's human oversight features will be implemented behind feature flags to allow for gradual adoption.

## Traceability Strategies

### Strategy 1: Phase-Based Directory Structure
Each phase's components are organized in directories that clearly indicate their phase relationship, making it easy to trace features back to their originating phase.

**Example**: `src/phase_6_3_1/` contains components specific to Phase 6.3.1.

### Strategy 2: Documentation References
All documentation includes references to related components and phases, ensuring clear traceability between documentation and implementation.

**Example**: Phase 7.0's implementation plan references specific files and directories in the repository.

### Strategy 3: Commit Tagging
All commits related to a specific phase are tagged with the phase identifier, making it easy to trace changes back to their originating phase.

**Example**: Commits for Phase 7.0 will be tagged with `[PHASE-7.0]`.

### Strategy 4: Dependency Documentation
All components include explicit documentation of their dependencies on other components, ensuring clear traceability of dependencies.

**Example**: Phase 8.0's adaptive governance components will document their dependencies on Phase 7.5's governance hierarchy.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Guideline 1: Maintain Backward Compatibility
All new features must maintain backward compatibility with existing components, ensuring that older systems continue to function correctly.

**Example**: Phase 8.0's adaptive governance must work with existing governance profiles from Phase 6.5.

### Guideline 2: Follow Extension Strategies
All new features must follow the established extension strategies, ensuring consistent architecture across phases.

**Example**: Phase 7.5's collaborative framework must use composition over inheritance when extending Phase 6.5's profiles.

### Guideline 3: Document Dependencies
All new features must document their dependencies on existing components, ensuring clear traceability of dependencies.

**Example**: Phase 9.0's human oversight must document its dependencies on Phase 8.5's role framework.

### Guideline 4: Implement Feature Flags
All new features must be implemented behind feature flags, allowing for gradual rollout and easy rollback if needed.

**Example**: Phase 8.0's ML-based domain detection must be implemented behind a feature flag.

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Architectural drift between phases | High | Medium | Regular architecture reviews, strict adherence to extension strategies |
| Dependency conflicts between phases | High | Medium | Comprehensive dependency documentation, automated dependency checking |
| Knowledge loss between phases | High | High | Thorough documentation, clear traceability, knowledge transfer sessions |
| Feature flag complexity | Medium | Medium | Feature flag management system, regular cleanup of obsolete flags |
| Backward compatibility issues | High | Medium | Comprehensive testing, clear compatibility requirements |

## Conclusion

This architectural continuity document provides a comprehensive mapping between future roadmap phases and the existing repository structure, ensuring clear traceability and preventing knowledge loss between development cycles. By following the extension and traceability strategies outlined in this document, the Promethios project can maintain architectural integrity throughout its development lifecycle while continuing to evolve and expand its capabilities.

The document will be regularly updated as new phases are implemented, ensuring that it remains a reliable reference for the entire development team.
