# Shared Context Multi-Agent Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
Ungoverned agents with shared context will fail more often than governed agents due to coordination problems, despite having access to the same information.

## Why Ungoverned Agents Will Struggle

### **Coordination Failures**
- **Duplicate Work**: Multiple agents tackling the same sub-task without coordination
- **Conflicting Information**: Agents providing contradictory data or recommendations
- **Dropped Handoffs**: Agents making commitments they don't follow through on (like CMU's HR-IT example)
- **No Accountability**: No mechanism to ensure agents fulfill their promises

### **Communication Chaos**
- **Talking Over Each Other**: No turn-taking or communication protocols
- **Inconsistent Formats**: Each agent using different data structures or presentation styles
- **Context Loss**: Agents not properly building on each other's contributions
- **Unresolved Conflicts**: When agents disagree, no framework for resolution

### **Quality Control Issues**
- **No Verification**: Agents accepting each other's work without validation
- **Error Propagation**: Mistakes from one agent affecting the entire team's output
- **Inconsistent Standards**: No shared quality benchmarks or compliance requirements

## How Governance Will Improve Coordination

### **Natural Coordination Mechanisms**
- **Trust Scores**: Encourage agents to verify and validate each other's contributions
- **Policy Compliance**: Create consistent standards and formats across all agents
- **Audit Trails**: Enable proper tracking of handoffs and responsibilities
- **Conflict Resolution**: Provide structured mechanisms for handling disagreements

### **Accountability Framework**
- **Commitment Tracking**: Governance logs when agents make promises
- **Follow-through Verification**: System checks that commitments are fulfilled
- **Quality Gates**: Validation checkpoints before work is passed between agents
- **Performance Metrics**: Track coordination effectiveness and improvement

## Expected Experimental Results

### **Ungoverned Team Behaviors**
- **Chaotic Communication**: Similar to CMU's dysfunctional agent interactions
- **Incomplete Tasks**: Dropped handoffs and unfulfilled commitments
- **Inconsistent Quality**: Wide variation in output standards
- **Coordination Overhead**: Time wasted on miscommunication and rework

### **Governed Team Behaviors**
- **Structured Collaboration**: Clear protocols for information sharing
- **Reliable Handoffs**: Governance ensures commitments are tracked and fulfilled
- **Consistent Quality**: Shared standards and validation processes
- **Efficient Coordination**: Reduced overhead through better organization

## Metrics to Track

### **Coordination Effectiveness**
- **Handoff Success Rate**: Percentage of successful task transfers between agents
- **Duplicate Work Incidents**: Number of times multiple agents work on same task
- **Conflict Resolution Time**: How quickly disagreements are resolved
- **Communication Efficiency**: Ratio of productive vs. redundant messages

### **Task Completion Quality**
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of tasks fully completed
- **Quality Consistency**: Variance in output quality across agents
- **Error Propagation**: Number of mistakes that spread through the team
- **Rework Requirements**: Amount of work that needs to be redone

### **Governance Impact**
- **Trust Score Evolution**: How agent trust scores change over time
- **Policy Compliance Rate**: Adherence to governance standards
- **Accountability Metrics**: Commitment fulfillment rates
- **Overall Team Performance**: Comparative analysis of governed vs ungoverned outcomes

## Implementation Strategy

### **Shared Context Design**
- All agents see the full conversation history
- Agents can reference and build on each other's contributions
- Real-time updates as each agent contributes
- Clear visibility into who is working on what

### **Governance Integration**
- Trust verification at each handoff point
- Policy compliance checks during collaboration
- Audit trail generation for all interactions
- Conflict resolution protocols when needed

### **Natural Behavior Observation**
- Let agents self-organize without forced workflows
- Observe organic collaboration patterns
- Document governance intervention points
- Measure improvement in coordination over time

This experiment will demonstrate that governance is not about control, but about enabling better natural collaboration between agents.
