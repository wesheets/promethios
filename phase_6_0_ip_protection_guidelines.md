# Phase 6.0: IP Protection Guidelines for UI Implementation

## Executive Summary

This document outlines intellectual property (IP) protection guidelines for the Promethios UI implementation in Phase 6.0. These guidelines ensure that while the UI provides transparency, auditability, and governance visibility, it does not expose proprietary algorithms, source code, or unique architectural designs that constitute Promethios's competitive advantage.

## 1. IP Protection Principles

### 1.1 Abstracted Data Presentation

The UI should present abstracted results of governance processes rather than underlying implementation details:

- **Show What, Not How**: Display governance decisions, trust scores, and policy enforcement results without revealing the algorithms that produced them
- **Metadata Over Implementation**: Focus on timestamps, event types, and outcomes rather than processing logic
- **Summarized Metrics**: Use aggregated metrics and trends rather than raw data that might expose proprietary calculations

### 1.2 Separation of Concerns

Maintain clear separation between what is displayed in the UI and what remains in the backend:

- **UI Layer**: Presents governance events, logs, metrics, and visualizations
- **Business Logic Layer**: Contains proprietary algorithms, decision logic, and processing (never exposed in UI)
- **Data Layer**: Stores raw data and detailed logs (accessed only through controlled APIs)

### 1.3 Need-to-Know Access

Implement role-based access controls that limit information exposure:

- **Operators**: Access to operational dashboards and controls
- **Auditors**: Access to compliance reports and audit logs
- **Administrators**: Access to system configuration and settings
- **Developers**: Access to API documentation (but not implementation details)

## 2. Data Sanitization Requirements

### 2.1 Log Sanitization

All logs displayed in the UI or available for export must be sanitized to remove sensitive information:

- **Remove Internal Identifiers**: Replace internal system IDs with public-facing identifiers
- **Redact Algorithm Parameters**: Remove any parameters that reveal proprietary algorithm details
- **Sanitize Error Messages**: Ensure error messages don't reveal implementation details or stack traces
- **Filter Sensitive Data**: Remove any personally identifiable information (PII) or confidential data

### 2.2 Export Sanitization

Additional sanitization for data exports:

- **Compliance Templates**: Ensure templates only include required fields for compliance, not implementation details
- **Data Minimization**: Provide options to export only the minimum necessary data for a specific purpose
- **Metadata Stripping**: Remove internal metadata, debug information, and developer comments
- **Format Standardization**: Convert proprietary data formats to standard formats (JSON, CSV, PDF)

### 2.3 Merkle Proof Protection

For Merkle proofs and integrity verification:

- **Hash-Only Verification**: Provide hash values and verification methods without exposing the hashing implementation
- **Abstract Verification Scripts**: Verification scripts should validate integrity without revealing the underlying cryptographic implementation
- **Sealed Verification**: Use sealed verification methods that confirm integrity without exposing the data structure

## 3. Access Control Recommendations

### 3.1 Authentication and Authorization

Implement robust authentication and authorization:

- **Strong Authentication**: Require multi-factor authentication for UI access
- **Fine-grained Authorization**: Implement role-based access control for different UI components
- **Session Management**: Enforce session timeouts and secure session handling
- **Audit Access**: Log all access to sensitive UI components and exports

### 3.2 Component-Level Access Controls

Apply access controls at the component level:

| UI Component | Operator | Auditor | Administrator | Developer |
|-------------|----------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Emotion Telemetry Logs | View | View | View, Configure | No Access |
| Justification Logs | View | View | View, Configure | No Access |
| Override Management | View, Request | View | View, Configure | No Access |
| Audit Export | Export | Export | Configure | No Access |
| Adversarial Testing | No Access | No Access | View, Configure | View |
| Governance Impact | View | View | View, Configure | View |
| Codex Dashboard | View | View | View, Configure | No Access |
| UI Readiness | View | No Access | View, Configure | View |

### 3.3 Export Controls

Implement controls for data exports:

- **Watermarking**: Add watermarks to exported documents to track their origin
- **Export Logging**: Log all export activities with user information and purpose
- **Rate Limiting**: Limit the frequency and volume of exports to prevent data harvesting
- **Approval Workflow**: Require approval for exports of sensitive or large datasets

## 4. Visualization Protection

### 4.1 Visualization Guidelines

Ensure visualizations don't inadvertently expose proprietary information:

- **Abstracted Metrics**: Display high-level metrics rather than raw data
- **Relative vs. Absolute**: Use relative measures (percentages, ratios) rather than absolute values when appropriate
- **Aggregated Data**: Show aggregated trends rather than individual data points
- **Limited Precision**: Reduce numerical precision to prevent reverse engineering of algorithms

### 4.2 Chart and Graph Protection

Specific protections for charts and graphs:

- **No Raw Data Downloads**: Disable raw data downloads from charts and graphs
- **Limited Drill-Down**: Control the depth of drill-down capabilities
- **Obfuscated Axes**: Use normalized or relative scales rather than absolute values
- **Simplified Visualizations**: Avoid complex visualizations that might reveal algorithmic patterns

### 4.3 Comparison View Protection

For side-by-side comparisons of governed vs. non-governed runs:

- **Focus on Outcomes**: Show differences in outcomes, not processing details
- **Highlight Governance Impact**: Emphasize governance benefits without revealing mechanism
- **Selective Metrics**: Display only metrics that don't expose proprietary logic
- **Aggregated Differences**: Show summary of differences rather than detailed breakdowns

## 5. IP Protection Checklist

## 6. Implementation Guidelines

### 6.1 Code-Level Protection

Implement code-level protections:

```python
# Example: Sanitizing log entries before display
def sanitize_log_entry(log_entry):
    """Sanitize a log entry for UI display."""
    sanitized = log_entry.copy()
    
    # Remove internal identifiers
    if 'internal_id' in sanitized:
        sanitized['id'] = f"LOG-{hash(sanitized['internal_id']) % 10000}"
        del sanitized['internal_id']
    
    # Redact algorithm parameters
    if 'algorithm_params' in sanitized:
        sanitized['algorithm'] = sanitized['algorithm_params'].get('name', 'Unknown')
        del sanitized['algorithm_params']
    
    # Sanitize error messages
    if 'error' in sanitized and 'stack_trace' in sanitized['error']:
        sanitized['error'] = {'message': sanitized['error'].get('message', 'An error occurred')}
    
    return sanitized
```

### 6.2 API Protection

Implement API-level protections:

```python
# Example: API endpoint with access control and data minimization
@app.route('/api/v1/governance_impact/<task_id>')
@requires_auth(['operator', 'auditor', 'administrator'])
def get_governance_impact(task_id):
    """Get governance impact for a task."""
    # Check authorization for this specific task
    if not current_user_can_access_task(task_id):
        return jsonify({'error': 'Unauthorized'}), 403
    
    # Get raw impact data
    impact_data = get_raw_governance_impact(task_id)
    
    # Apply data minimization based on user role
    minimized_data = minimize_data_for_role(impact_data, current_user.role)
    
    # Log access
    log_data_access('governance_impact', task_id, current_user.id)
    
    return jsonify(minimized_data)
```

### 6.3 Frontend Protection

Implement frontend protections:

```javascript
// Example: Preventing data extraction from charts
function createGovernanceImpactChart(data, container) {
    // Create chart with disabled data export
    const chart = new Chart(container, {
        data: data,
        options: {
            plugins: {
                // Disable data export
                export: false,
                // Disable tooltip raw values
                tooltip: {
                    callbacks: {
                        label: function(context) {
                            // Show relative values instead of absolute
                            return context.dataset.label + ': ' + 
                                   (context.raw > 0 ? '+' : '') + 
                                   Math.round(context.raw * 100) + '%';
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    });
    
    return chart;
}
```
