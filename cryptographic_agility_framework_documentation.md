# Cryptographic Agility Framework Documentation

## Overview

The Cryptographic Agility Framework provides a robust and flexible infrastructure for managing cryptographic operations within the Promethios governance system. This framework enables the system to adapt to evolving cryptographic standards and threats, ensuring long-term security and compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Architecture

The Cryptographic Agility Framework is built on a modular architecture with the following key components:

1. **Crypto Manager**: Central coordinator for all cryptographic operations, managing algorithms, keys, and cryptographic operations.

2. **Algorithm Providers**: Specialized components that implement various cryptographic algorithms for different operations.

3. **Key Providers**: Components responsible for generating and managing cryptographic keys.

4. **Policy Manager**: Enforces cryptographic policies across different domains in the governance system.

5. **Audit Logger**: Provides comprehensive audit logging for all cryptographic operations.

- Coordinates key generation and rotation
- Provides interfaces for cryptographic operations (hash, encrypt, decrypt, sign, verify)
- Enforces cryptographic policies through integration with the Policy Manager
- Logs cryptographic operations through integration with the Audit Logger

### Algorithm Providers

Specialized providers for different types of cryptographic algorithms:

- **HashAlgorithmProvider**: Implements various hash algorithms for data integrity.
- **SymmetricAlgorithmProvider**: Implements symmetric encryption algorithms for data confidentiality.
- **AsymmetricAlgorithmProvider**: Implements asymmetric encryption algorithms for key exchange and encryption.
- **SignatureAlgorithmProvider**: Implements signature algorithms for data authenticity and integrity.

### Key Providers

Components that generate and manage cryptographic keys:

- **SymmetricKeyProvider**: Generates and manages keys for symmetric encryption algorithms.
- **AsymmetricKeyProvider**: Generates and manages key pairs for asymmetric encryption and signature algorithms.

### Policy Manager

The Crypto Policy Manager defines and enforces cryptographic policies across different domains in the governance system. It:

- Manages domain-specific cryptographic policies
- Validates algorithms and keys against policy requirements
- Enforces minimum security strength requirements
- Manages key lifecycle and rotation policies

### Audit Logger

The Crypto Audit Logger provides comprehensive audit logging for all cryptographic operations, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and enabling security analysis. It:

- Logs all cryptographic operations (algorithm registration, key generation, encryption, decryption, signing, verification)
- Provides filtering and search capabilities for audit logs
- Generates audit reports for compliance and security analysis
- Manages log retention and cleanup

## Cryptographic Operations

The framework supports the following cryptographic operations:

1. **Hashing**: Computing cryptographic hashes of data for integrity verification.
2. **Encryption/Decryption**: Protecting data confidentiality using symmetric encryption.
3. **Signing/Verification**: Ensuring data authenticity and integrity using digital signatures.
4. **Key Generation**: Creating cryptographic keys for various algorithms.
5. **Key Rotation**: Regularly updating cryptographic keys to limit exposure.
6. **Algorithm Transition**: Migrating from one algorithm to another as security requirements evolve.

## Algorithm Agility

The framework provides algorithm agility through:

1. **Algorithm Registration**: New algorithms can be registered at runtime.
2. **Algorithm Transition**: The system can transition from one algorithm to another with minimal disruption.
3. **Domain-Specific Algorithms**: Different domains can use different algorithms based on their security requirements.
4. **Policy-Driven Selection**: Algorithm selection is driven by cryptographic policies.

## Key Management

The framework provides comprehensive key management capabilities:

1. **Key Generation**: Keys are generated using secure random number generators.
2. **Key Storage**: Keys are securely stored with appropriate access controls.
3. **Key Rotation**: Keys are regularly rotated to limit exposure.
4. **Key Lifecycle Management**: Keys transition through active, deprecated, and retired states.

## Policy Enforcement

The framework enforces cryptographic policies through:

1. **Algorithm Validation**: Algorithms are validated against policy requirements before use.
2. **Key Validation**: Keys are validated against policy requirements before use.
3. **Minimum Strength Requirements**: Policies define minimum strength requirements for algorithms and keys.
4. **Key Lifecycle Policies**: Policies define maximum key ages and rotation requirements.

## Audit and Compliance

The framework supports audit and compliance requirements through:

1. **Comprehensive Logging**: All cryptographic operations are logged.
2. **Audit Reports**: The system can generate audit reports for compliance and security analysis.
3. **Log Retention**: Logs are retained according to configurable retention policies.
4. **Compliance Mapping**: The framework maps to various compliance frameworks (SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA).

## Integration with Other Components

The Cryptographic Agility Framework integrates with:

- **Distributed Consensus Mechanism**: For securing consensus operations.
- **Governance Recovery Mechanisms**: For securing recovery operations.
- **Formal Verification Framework**: For verifying cryptographic properties.
- **Cross-System Governance Interoperability**: For secure cross-system communication.
- **API Governance Scaffolding**: For securing API operations.
