## Key Issues Identified:
1. **NotificationTestButton using placeholder data**: Line 31 uses 'test-sender-id' instead of real user ID
2. **Need real user lookup system**: Collaboration invitations need to work with actual user accounts
3. **Message persistence**: LightweightFloatingChat needs connection to real message storage
4. **Integration gaps**: Need to connect floating chat to existing conversation system
