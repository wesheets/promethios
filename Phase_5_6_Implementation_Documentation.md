# Phase 5.6: Distributed Trust Surface Implementation Documentation

**Codex Contract Version:** v2025.05.18  
**Phase ID:** 5.6  
**Clauses:** 5.6, 5.5, 5.4, 11.0, 11.1, 5.2.6  
**Implementation Date:** May 19, 2025  

## Overview

Phase 5.6 implements the Distributed Trust Surface for the Promethios platform, enabling secure and verifiable trust relationships between distributed instances. This implementation follows the canonical repository structure established in Phase 5.2.6.1 and integrates with the Governance Mesh (Phase 5.5) and Distributed Verification Network (Phase 5.4).

The Distributed Trust Surface provides mechanisms for establishing, verifying, and propagating trust across the network, with cryptographic attestations ensuring the integrity and authenticity of trust relationships.

## Core Components

### 1. Trust Boundary Manager

**Path:** `src/core/governance/trust_boundary_manager.py`

The Trust Boundary Manager defines and enforces trust boundaries between Promethios instances. It manages:

- Creation and management of trust boundaries
- Trust level assignment and updates
- Boundary policy enforcement
- Boundary revocation and lifecycle management

### 2. Trust Surface Protocol

**Path:** `src/core/governance/trust_surface_protocol.py`

The Trust Surface Protocol defines the communication protocol for trust surface interactions, including:

- Protocol message creation and validation
- Message signing and verification
- Processing of boundary and attestation requests
- Trust verification operations

### 3. Attestation Service

**Path:** `src/core/governance/attestation_service.py`

The Attestation Service generates and validates trust attestations between Promethios instances:

- Creation of cryptographically verifiable attestations
- Attestation chain management
- Verification of attestations and attestation chains
- Attestation revocation and lifecycle management

### 4. Trust Propagation Engine

**Path:** `src/core/governance/trust_propagation_engine.py`

The Trust Propagation Engine manages the propagation of trust across the distributed network:

- Trust graph management
- Trust decay and reinforcement mechanisms
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Transitive trust path calculation

### 5. Boundary Enforcement Module

**Path:** `src/core/governance/boundary_enforcement_module.py`

The Boundary Enforcement Module enforces trust boundary policies and access control:

- Policy enforcement for cross-boundary operations
- Attestation requirement enforcement
- Trust level verification
- Enforcement action logging and auditing

## Schema Definitions

The following JSON schemas define the data structures used by the Distributed Trust Surface:

1. **Trust Boundary Schema** (`src/schemas/governance/trust_boundary.schema.v1.json`)
   - Defines trust boundaries between Promethios instances
   - Includes trust levels, policies, and boundary metadata

2. **Trust Attestation Schema** (`src/schemas/governance/trust_attestation.schema.v1.json`)
   - Defines attestations of trust between instances
   - Includes attestation chains, cryptographic signatures, and verification metadata

3. **Trust Surface Protocol Schema** (`src/schemas/governance/trust_surface_protocol.schema.v1.json`)
   - Defines the protocol messages for trust surface communication
   - Includes message types, payloads, and routing information

## Integration Points

### Integration with Governance Mesh (Phase 5.5)

The Distributed Trust Surface integrates with the Governance Mesh to:

- Synchronize trust boundaries across the mesh
- Propagate attestations through the mesh network
- Enforce governance policies based on trust relationships
- Resolve conflicts through mesh consensus

### Integration with Distributed Verification Network (Phase 5.4)

The Distributed Trust Surface integrates with the Verification Network to:

- Verify the authenticity of attestations
- Validate trust boundaries against verification nodes
- Ensure consistency of trust relationships across the network
- Detect and prevent malicious attestation attempts

### Integration with Merkle Sealing (Phase 5.3)

The Distributed Trust Surface leverages Merkle Sealing to:

- Seal attestation chains for tamper-proof verification
- Create verifiable records of trust boundary changes
- Provide cryptographic proof of trust relationships
- Enable historical verification of trust state

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage is provided for all components:

- Unit tests for individual component functionality
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Schema validation tests
- Codex compliance tests

All tests are located in the `tests/core/governance/` directory, following the canonical test structure.

## Codex Contract Compliance

This implementation complies with the following Codex Contract clauses:

- **Clause 5.6**: Distributed Trust Surface requirements
- **Clause 5.5**: Governance Mesh integration requirements
- **Clause 5.4**: Distributed Verification Network integration requirements
- **Clause 11.0**: Security and cryptographic requirements
- **Clause 11.1**: Trust propagation and verification requirements
- **Clause 5.2.6**: Repository structure governance requirements

## Usage Examples

### Establishing Trust Boundaries

```python
from src.core.governance.trust_boundary_manager import TrustBoundaryManager

# Initialize the Trust Boundary Manager
manager = TrustBoundaryManager(instance_id="pi-1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef")

# Create a trust boundary
boundary = manager.create_boundary(
    source_instance_id="pi-1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef",
    target_instance_id="pi-abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890",
    trust_level=75,
    boundary_type="operational",
    boundary_data={"purpose": "data_exchange"}
)

# Create a boundary policy
policy = manager.create_boundary_policy(
    boundary_id=boundary["boundary_id"],
    policy_type="access_control",
    policy_data={
        "allowed_operations": ["read", "write"],
        "restricted_operations": ["delete", "admin"]
    }
)
```

### Creating and Verifying Attestations

```python
from src.core.governance.attestation_service import AttestationService

# Initialize the Attestation Service
service = AttestationService(instance_id="pi-1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef")

# Create an attestation
attestation = service.create_attestation(
    attestation_type="identity",
    subject_instance_id="pi-abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890",
    attestation_data={"identity": "verified_instance"}
)

# Verify the attestation
is_valid, result = service.verify_attestation(
    attestation_id=attestation["attestation_id"]
)

# Create a chained attestation
chained_attestation = service.create_attestation_chain(
    parent_attestation_id=attestation["attestation_id"],
    attestation_type="capability",
    subject_instance_id="pi-abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890",
    attestation_data={"capability": "data_processing"}
)

# Verify the attestation chain
is_valid, result = service.verify_attestation_chain(
    attestation_id=chained_attestation["attestation_id"]
)
```

### Using the Trust Surface Protocol

```python
from src.core.governance.trust_surface_protocol import TrustSurfaceProtocol

# Initialize the Trust Surface Protocol
protocol = TrustSurfaceProtocol(instance_id="pi-1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef")

# Create a protocol message
message = protocol.create_protocol_message(
    message_type="attestation_request",
    target_instance_id="pi-abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890",
    payload={
        "attestation_type": "identity",
        "request_id": "req-1234567890abcdef"
    }
)

# Validate the message
is_valid, errors = protocol.validate_protocol_message(message)

# Process an attestation request
response = protocol.process_attestation_request(message)
```

## Deployment Considerations

When deploying the Distributed Trust Surface:

1. **Initial Trust Establishment**: Bootstrap trust relationships between known instances
2. **Key Management**: Ensure proper management of cryptographic keys for attestation signing
3. **Trust Decay**: Configure appropriate trust decay rates based on operational requirements
4. **Boundary Policies**: Define clear boundary policies for different types of interactions
5. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for trust conflicts and resolution events

## Conclusion

The Phase 5.6 Distributed Trust Surface implementation provides a robust foundation for establishing and managing trust in the distributed Promethios network. By integrating with the Governance Mesh and Verification Network, it ensures that trust relationships are consistent, verifiable, and secure across the entire platform.

This implementation follows the canonical repository structure and complies with all relevant Codex Contract clauses, providing a solid foundation for future phases of the Promethios project.
