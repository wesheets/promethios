# Governance Sentinel 13B - Complete Training Package

## Overview

This is the complete training package for the Governance Sentinel 13B model, which builds upon our proven 7B foundation with enhanced capabilities and comprehensive bias elimination. The training combines:

1. **7B Foundation Layer** - Proven governance capabilities from our successful $50/4-hour training
2. **13B Enhanced Layer** - Advanced nuanced reasoning, cross-cultural understanding, and bias-free operation
3. **Comprehensive Bias Elimination** - Multi-level bias prevention and monitoring throughout training
