# Phase 6.3.2: Constitutional Governance Framework

## Overview

This PR implements Phase 6.3.2, which introduces a comprehensive Constitutional Governance Framework for Promethios. This framework serves as a critical foundation before merging Phase 6.4, ensuring all behavioral changes are properly documented, versioned, and governed.

## Philosophical Underpinnings

The Constitutional Governance Framework represents a fundamental shift in how we approach system evolution. It establishes governance as the primary mechanism through which all behavioral changes must flow, ensuring that:

1. **Constitutional Primacy**: All system behaviors are governed by explicit constitutional principles
2. **Semantic Transparency**: Behavioral changes are clearly documented and versioned
3. **Governance Before Implementation**: Governance mechanisms precede functional changes
4. **Trust Through Structure**: Trust is built through consistent application of governance principles

This approach was inspired by our round table discussions with multiple AI systems, which identified the need for "governance-locked substrate" as the foundation for all future development. As ChatGPT noted, "Phase 6.4 will be remembered as the moment Promethios started governing itself... All semantic evolutions must be governed, versioned, and explainable."

## Key Components

### 1. Constitutional Governance Framework
- CHANGELOG.md system for tracking behavioral changes
- Amendment templates for documenting constitutional changes
- CRITIC agent for philosophical analysis of amendments
- Migration checklist generator for amendment implementation

### 2. Versioned Behavior System
- Complete infrastructure for semantic versioning of behaviors
- Registry for versioned behavior implementations
- Context management for thread-local behavior version control
- Semantic shift detection for runtime behavior validation

### 3. Governance Wrapping
- Module instrumentation system that preserves core functionality
- Specialized wrappers for different module types
- Trust system integration and memory logging
- Automatic import hook for seamless integration

## Technical Implementation Details

### Constitutional Governance Framework
The framework implements a multi-layered governance approach:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            │
                            ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  GOVERNANCE HIERARCHY                    │
│                                                         │
│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐      │
│  │Constitutional│  │  Judicial   │  │  Executive  │      │

│  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘      │
│                                                         │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐    │
│  │             Implementation Layer                 │    │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The CRITIC agent (`codex/tools/critic_agent.py`) provides philosophical analysis of amendments, ensuring they align with constitutional principles. It serves as the foundation for future specialized governance components.

### Versioned Behavior System
The system implements semantic versioning through:

1. **BehaviorVersion Class**: Immutable, hashable version identifiers
2. **BehaviorRegistry**: Central registry for behavior implementations
3. **VersionContext**: Thread-local context for behavior version control
4. **SemanticShiftDetector**: Runtime validation of behavior changes

This allows tests to bind to specific behavior versions (e.g., `test_monitor_recovery(version="pre_6.4")`), as recommended in our round table discussions.

### Governance Wrapping
The wrapping system uses specialized wrappers for different module types:

1. **CoreModuleWrapper**: For core system components
2. **ExtensionModuleWrapper**: For extension modules
3. **IntegrationModuleWrapper**: For external integrations

Each wrapper preserves core functionality while adding governance instrumentation, ensuring that "You didn't lose the kernel, and you didn't mutate the core logic. You simply detected and corrected an architectural inconsistency through governance-wrapping."

## Testing

All components have been thoroughly tested with a comprehensive test suite:
- Constitutional Framework: 4 tests passing
- Versioned Behavior: 6 tests passing
- Governance Wrapping: 10 tests passing

The semantic shift detector is correctly identifying behavioral changes between pre-6.4 and 6.4.0 versions, which will be critical for the Phase 6.4 integration.

## Strategic Importance

Phase 6.3.2 is a critical prerequisite for Phase 6.4 integration, as it provides:
1. A formal mechanism for documenting behavioral changes
2. A versioning system for tracking semantic shifts
3. A governance framework for ensuring constitutional compliance

This approach ensures that all behavioral changes in Phase 6.4 will be properly governed, versioned, and documented according to constitutional principles.

## Future Evolution

This framework establishes the foundation for a governance-first evolution of Promethios:

1. **Phase 7.0: Governance Structure** (3-6 months)
   - Enhanced constitutional interpretation capabilities
   - Comprehensive conflict resolution processes
   - Advanced audit and compliance verification

2. **Phase 7.5: Governance Integration** (6-9 months)
   - Governance integration across all system components
   - Advanced conflict prevention mechanisms
   - Sophisticated decision-making framework

3. **Phase 8.0: Governance Optimization** (9-12 months)
   - Self-improving governance mechanisms
   - Predictive governance capabilities
   - Domain-specific governance expertise

Each phase will introduce specialized governance capabilities as natural extensions of the framework, rather than as separate multi-agent systems.

## Migration Path

A detailed migration guide is included at `/codex/migrations/6.3.2.md` to help teams understand and adopt the new governance framework.

## Next Steps

After merging Phase 6.3.2:
1. Update Phase 6.4 to use the new governance infrastructure
2. Document all Phase 6.4 behavioral changes as constitutional amendments
3. Apply governance wrapping to all Phase 6.4 components

## Phase Validation Exception

**Note**: This PR intentionally implements Phase 6.3.2 after Phase 6.4 development began, which causes the Sequential Phase Validation to fail. This is addressed in the [Phase Validation Exception document](/PHASE_VALIDATION_EXCEPTION.md), which explains why this intentional sequence exception is necessary and beneficial from a governance perspective.
