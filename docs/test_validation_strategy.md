# Test Validation Strategy for Promethios

## Overview

This document outlines the test validation strategy for the Promethios project, implemented as part of Phase 5.2.6.2: Test Validation Layer. The strategy establishes a structured approach to testing that enforces phase isolation, sequential validation, and governance compliance.

## Codex Contract Compliance

- **Contract Version**: v2025.05.18
- **Phase ID**: 5.2.6.2
- **Clauses**: 5.2.6 (Repository Structure Normalization), 5.2.5 (Repository Hygiene Freeze), 11.0 (Testing and Validation Requirements)

## Test Organization

### Directory Structure

Tests are organized into phase-specific directories following the canonical structure:

```
tests/
├── phase_2_3/           # Core Kernel tests (foundational)
│   ├── unit/
│   └── integration/
├── phase_5_1/           # Initial implementation tests
│   ├── unit/
│   └── integration/
├── phase_5_2/           # Replay Reproducibility Seal tests
│   ├── unit/
│   └── integration/
├── phase_5_3/           # Merkle Sealing + Conflict Metadata tests
│   ├── unit/
│   └── integration/
├── phase_5_4/           # Distributed Verification Network tests
│   ├── unit/
│   └── integration/
├── phase_5_5/           # Governance Mesh Integration tests
│   ├── unit/
│   └── integration/
├── end_to_end/          # End-to-end tests across phases
└── conftest.py          # Common test configuration and fixtures
```

### Test Markers

All tests are tagged with pytest markers to enable phase-specific test selection:

- `@pytest.mark.phase_2_3` - Core Kernel tests
- `@pytest.mark.phase_5_1` - Initial implementation tests
- `@pytest.mark.phase_5_2` - Replay Reproducibility Seal tests
- `@pytest.mark.phase_5_3` - Merkle Sealing + Conflict Metadata tests
- `@pytest.mark.phase_5_4` - Distributed Verification Network tests
- `@pytest.mark.phase_5_5` - Governance Mesh Integration tests
- `@pytest.mark.end_to_end` - End-to-end tests across phases

## Sequential Test Validation

### Validation Pipeline

The sequential test validation pipeline (`scripts/validate_phases.py`) enforces the following phase order:

1. Phase 2.3 (Core Kernel)
2. Phase 5.1 (Initial implementation)
3. Phase 5.2 (Replay Reproducibility Seal)
4. Phase 5.3 (Merkle Sealing + Conflict Metadata)
5. Phase 5.4 (Distributed Verification Network)
6. Phase 5.5 (Governance Mesh Integration)

This ensures that foundational components are tested first, and that each phase builds upon a validated foundation.

### Pipeline Features

- **Sequential Execution**: Tests are run in phase order, ensuring earlier phases pass before testing later phases
- **Fail-Fast Mode**: By default, the pipeline stops on the first phase failure
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates comprehensive reports with test counts, durations, and failure details
- **Governance Compliance**: Validates that all tests adhere to Codex contract requirements

## Registry Integration

The test registry (`registry/test_registry.json`) maintains metadata about all tests, including:

- Phase association
- Dependencies
- Canonical paths
- Purpose
- Pytest markers

This registry is used for traceability, dependency tracking, and governance compliance verification.

## Continuous Integration

The test validation pipeline is designed to be integrated into CI workflows to enforce:

- All tests must pass for their respective phases
- New features must not break existing functionality
- Phase dependencies must be respected
- Governance compliance must be maintained

## Usage

### Running All Tests Sequentially

```bash
python scripts/validate_phases.py --report
```

### Running Tests for a Specific Phase

```bash
python -m pytest tests/phase_5_3 -m phase_5_3 -v
```

### Generating a Test Report

```bash
python scripts/validate_phases.py --report --report-file test_results/validation_report.md
```

## Governance Requirements

1. **Phase Isolation**: Tests for each phase must be isolated and not depend on later phases
2. **Backward Compatibility**: New features must not break existing functionality
3. **Traceability**: All tests must be traceable to their respective phases and Codex clauses
4. **Documentation**: Test strategy and requirements must be thoroughly documented
5. **Validation**: All tests must be validated before merging new features

## Future Enhancements

1. **Coverage Analysis**: Add test coverage analysis to ensure comprehensive testing
2. **Performance Metrics**: Track test performance metrics over time
3. **Automated Dependency Validation**: Automatically validate test dependencies against the module registry
4. **Integration with Phase 5.6**: Extend the validation pipeline to include Phase 5.6 (Distributed Trust Surface)

## Conclusion

This test validation strategy establishes a robust foundation for ensuring the integrity, reliability, and governance compliance of the Promethios project. By enforcing phase isolation and sequential validation, it helps maintain backward compatibility and facilitates the integration of new features.
