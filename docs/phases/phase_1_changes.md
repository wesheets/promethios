# Repository Structure Normalization - Phase 1 Changes

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made in Phase 1 of the repository structure normalization as defined in Codex clause 5.2.6. The goal of this phase is to establish the canonical directory structure and begin moving files to their proper locations while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Changes Implemented

1. **Established Canonical Directory Structure**
   - Created the canonical directory hierarchy as defined in the module registry
   - Set up the foundation for all future file organization

2. **Created Module Registry**
   - Implemented `registry/module_registry.json` to map all modules to their purpose, phase, and dependencies
   - Established the source of truth for file locations and relationships

3. **Moved Initial Batch of Files**
   - Migrated schema files to domain-specific subdirectories
   - Moved test files to appropriate test directories
   - Relocated documentation files to the docs directory
   - Created compatibility layers for moved Python modules

4. **Updated Import Statements**
   - Updated import statements in all Python files to reference the new canonical locations
   - Ensured code continues to function during the transition

5. **Created Migration Tracking**
   - Implemented `registry/migration_log.json` to track all file moves
   - Established traceability for governance compliance

## File Moves Summary

### Schema Files
- Moved schema files from `schemas/` to domain-specific subdirectories:
  - Core schemas to `schemas/core/`
  - Verification schemas to `schemas/verification/`
  - Governance schemas to `schemas/governance/`
  - Replay schemas to `schemas/replay/`

### Test Files
- Moved test files to appropriate test directories:
  - Unit tests to `tests/unit/`
  - Integration tests to `tests/integration/`
  - End-to-end tests to `tests/end_to_end/`

### Documentation Files
- Moved documentation files to the docs directory:
  - Architecture documents to `docs/architecture/`
  - Implementation guides to `docs/implementation/`
  - Governance documents to `docs/governance/`

## Compatibility Approach

To ensure backward compatibility during the transition, we've implemented:

1. **Compatibility Layers**
   - Created compatibility modules in `src/compatibility/` that redirect imports to canonical locations
   - Maintained the original import paths to prevent breaking existing code

2. **Import Statement Updates**
   - Updated import statements in all Python files to reference the new canonical locations
   - Ensured that moved modules can still import their dependencies

## Next Steps

Phase 1 establishes the foundation for the repository reorganization. Subsequent phases will:

1. **Phase 2**: Move core modules to their canonical locations
2. **Phase 3**: Move integration and utility modules
3. **Phase 4**: Move UI components
4. **Phase 5**: Complete the reorganization and remove compatibility layers

## Governance Compliance

This implementation adheres to Codex clause 5.2.6 "Repository Structure Normalization" while maintaining compatibility with existing code. All changes are tracked in the migration log for governance traceability.

## Migration Script

The migration is automated using `scripts/migrate_repo_structure.py`, which:
- Moves files to their canonical locations
- Creates compatibility layers
- Updates import statements
- Logs all changes for traceability

This approach ensures consistency and minimizes the risk of errors during the reorganization process.
