# Phase 5.6: Distributed Trust Surface

## Codex Contract Reference
- **Contract Version:** v2025.05.18
- **Phase ID:** 5.6
- **Clauses:** 5.6, 5.5, 5.4, 11.0, 11.1, 5.2.6
- **Dependencies:** 5.5, 5.4, 11.0, 11.1

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the architecture and implementation plan for Phase 5.6 (Distributed Trust Surface) of the Promethios kernel. Building upon the Governance Mesh Integration (Phase 5.5) and Distributed Verification Network (Phase 5.4), this phase implements a distributed trust surface that enables secure, verifiable trust boundaries across multiple Promethios instances.

The implementation adheres to Clause 5.2.6 "Repository Structure Normalization" and provides explicit file placement instructions for both the current repository structure and the target normalized structure.

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

The Distributed Trust Surface establishes cryptographically verifiable trust boundaries between Promethios instances, enabling secure cross-instance operations while maintaining governance integrity. It creates a foundation for federated trust that preserves local sovereignty while enabling collaborative verification.

### 1.2 Core Components

1. **Trust Boundary Manager**
   - Defines and enforces trust boundaries between Promethios instances
   - Manages trust attestations and revocations
   - Implements boundary crossing protocols

2. **Trust Surface Protocol**
   - Defines the communication protocol for trust surface interactions
   - Implements secure message passing between trust boundaries
   - Ensures cryptographic verification of cross-boundary operations

3. **Attestation Service**
   - Generates and validates trust attestations
   - Maintains attestation chains and history
   - Provides attestation verification APIs

4. **Trust Propagation Engine**
   - Manages the propagation of trust across the distributed network
   - Implements trust decay and reinforcement mechanisms
   - Handles trust conflicts and resolution

5. **Boundary Enforcement Module**
   - Enforces trust boundary policies
   - Implements access control for cross-boundary operations
   - Provides audit logging for boundary crossings

### 1.3 Integration Points

1. **Governance Mesh Integration (Phase 5.5)**
   - Trust boundaries align with governance boundaries
   - Governance policies influence trust propagation
   - Contract synchronization respects trust boundaries

2. **Distributed Verification Network (Phase 5.4)**
   - Verification nodes participate in trust attestation
   - Consensus mechanisms validate trust boundaries
   - Network topology respects trust surface topology

3. **Merkle Sealing (Phase 5.3)**
   - Trust attestations are Merkle-sealed
   - Trust boundary crossings generate conflict metadata
   - Trust propagation is cryptographically verifiable

4. **UI Integration**
   - Trust boundaries visualized in UI-12.66 (Governance Mesh Visualization)
   - Trust attestations displayed in UI-12.21 (Codex Contract Dashboard)
   - Trust boundary violations reported in UI-12.33 (Drift Alert)

## 2. Implementation Plan

The implementation will follow the repository structure governance plan and will be organized according to the module registry system. All components will be implemented in a feature branch and submitted as a pull request following the PR governance process.

## 3. Timeline

1. Week 1: Schema Implementation and Core Design
2. Week 2: Core Component Implementation
3. Week 3: Additional Component Implementation
4. Week 4: Integration Implementation
5. Week 5: Testing and Documentation
6. Week 6: Review and Finalization

## 4. Governance Requirements

Ensure strict adherence to the Codex Contract Tethering Protocol throughout the implementation. All components must include proper phase and clause references, and all schema validations must be implemented as specified.
