# CMU Interactive Playground: Progressive Feature Rollout Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the phased approach for rolling out enhanced features to the CMU Interactive Playground, ensuring stability while transitioning from scripted demo agents to fully functional LLM-backed agents.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

**Status: Complete**
- Stable deployment with scripted demo agents
- Documentation of known good state
- Pre-deployment checklists established
- LLM integration plan created

## Phase 2: Developer Mode (Week 1-2)

**Goal: Enable LLM integration for developers only**

### Implementation Steps:
1. Add developer settings panel with keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+D)
2. Implement feature flag system for LLM vs. scripted agents
3. Create basic API endpoints for LLM interaction
4. Test with development team only

### Deliverables:
- Working developer toggle between scripted and LLM modes
- Basic LLM integration with OpenAI
- No changes to production deployment

## Phase 3: Enhanced Scenarios (Week 3-4)

**Goal: Expand scenario library and improve conversation flow**

### Implementation Steps:
1. Add 2-3 new scenarios beyond the current product planning scenario
2. Enhance conversation flow with more natural transitions
3. Improve the scenario selection UI
4. Add scenario-specific metrics and outcomes

### Deliverables:
- Expanded scenario library
- More engaging conversation flow
- Improved scenario selection experience
- Still using scripted agents in production

## Phase 4: Governance Visualization (Week 5-6)

**Goal: Enhance visualization of governance benefits**

### Implementation Steps:
1. Add real-time governance visualization
2. Create side-by-side comparison view of governed vs. ungoverned responses
3. Implement animated transitions for governance effects
4. Add detailed metrics for each governance feature

### Deliverables:
- Interactive governance visualization
- Enhanced metrics dashboard
- Visual indicators of governance effects
- Compatible with both scripted and LLM modes

## Phase 5: Limited LLM Rollout (Week 7-8)

**Goal: Enable LLM integration for specific scenarios**

### Implementation Steps:
1. Enable LLM integration for one scenario (product planning)
2. Add opt-in toggle for users to try LLM mode
3. Implement usage monitoring and error tracking
4. Maintain scripted mode as fallback

### Deliverables:
- Limited LLM integration in production
- User-facing toggle for LLM mode
- Usage metrics and monitoring
- Graceful fallback to scripted mode

## Phase 6: Full LLM Integration (Week 9-10)

**Goal: Make LLM mode the default experience**

### Implementation Steps:
1. Enable LLM integration for all scenarios
2. Make LLM mode the default experience
3. Optimize performance and reduce latency
4. Maintain scripted mode as emergency fallback

### Deliverables:
- Full LLM integration across all scenarios
- Optimized performance
- Comprehensive error handling
- Scripted mode available as fallback

## Testing Strategy for Each Phase

### Pre-Deployment Testing:
- Unit tests for new components
- Integration tests for feature interactions
- Browser compatibility testing
- Performance testing

### Post-Deployment Monitoring:
- Error rate tracking
- User engagement metrics
- Performance monitoring
- Feature usage statistics

## Rollback Plan for Each Phase

1. Identify trigger conditions for rollback (error threshold, performance degradation)
2. Document exact steps to disable new features
3. Maintain previous version in a separate branch for quick restoration
4. Test rollback procedure before each deployment

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success:
- Deployment stability maintained throughout all phases
- Error rates below 1% for all features
- Response time under 2 seconds for LLM interactions
- 99.9% uptime for the playground

### User Experience Success:
- Increased engagement with playground (session duration)
- Positive feedback on LLM interactions
- Higher conversion from playground to product interest
- Increased sharing of playground results

## Communication Plan

For each phase:
1. Announce upcoming changes to stakeholders
2. Provide documentation updates
3. Collect feedback after deployment
4. Adjust next phase based on feedback

## Resource Requirements

- Developer time: 2-3 developers part-time
- LLM API costs: Estimated $500-1000/month based on usage
- Testing resources: 1 QA engineer part-time
- Infrastructure: Current Render deployment with potential scaling
