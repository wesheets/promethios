# CMU Interactive Playground: Deployment Stability Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines strategies to maintain deployment stability for the CMU Interactive Playground while transitioning from scripted demo agents to fully functional LLM-backed agents.

## Stability Principles

1. **Incremental Changes**: Make small, targeted changes rather than large-scale refactoring
2. **Feature Flagging**: Implement feature flags to enable/disable new functionality
3. **Parallel Implementation**: Build new functionality alongside existing code before switching
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all changes thoroughly in development before deployment
5. **Rollback Readiness**: Always maintain the ability to quickly roll back to the last known good state

## Stability Checklist for LLM Integration

Before each deployment that enhances agent functionality:

- [ ] Verify all pre-deployment checklist items from the standard checklist
- [ ] Ensure new LLM integration code doesn't modify existing module interfaces
- [ ] Implement feature flags for all new LLM functionality
- [ ] Test with feature flags both enabled and disabled
- [ ] Verify the application works in "demo mode" even if LLM services are unavailable
- [ ] Document any new environment variables or configuration requirements
- [ ] Create a backup of the current working state

## Feature Flag Implementation

Add a feature flag system to control the transition from scripted to LLM-powered agents:

```javascript
// In main.js or a dedicated config file
const FeatureFlags = {
  USE_LLM_AGENTS: false,  // Set to true to enable real LLM agents
  LLM_PROVIDER: 'demo',   // Options: 'demo', 'openai', 'anthropic', etc.
  GOVERNANCE_FEATURES_ENABLED: true,
  DEBUG_MODE: false
};

// Example usage
function getAgentImplementation() {
  if (FeatureFlags.USE_LLM_AGENTS) {
    return new LLMAgentImplementation(FeatureFlags.LLM_PROVIDER);
  } else {
    return new ScriptedAgentImplementation();
  }
}
```

## Phased Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Preparation (Current State)
- Document current scripted implementation
- Add feature flag infrastructure
- Create interfaces for agent interactions

### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation
- Implement LLM agent code alongside scripted agents
- Keep feature flags disabled by default
- Test LLM implementation in development only

### Phase 3: Limited Testing
- Enable LLM features for specific test scenarios
- Maintain fallback to scripted agents
- Collect feedback and fix issues

### Phase 4: Full Deployment
- Enable LLM features by default
- Maintain scripted agents as fallback
- Monitor performance and user experience

## Monitoring and Recovery

- Implement logging to track agent interactions
- Set up alerts for LLM service disruptions
- Create a dashboard to monitor LLM usage and performance
- Document the process for disabling LLM features if issues arise

## Environment Variables

When implementing LLM integration, use environment variables for configuration:

```
LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4
USE_LLM_AGENTS=true
FALLBACK_TO_SCRIPTED=true
```

These should be configured in Render's environment settings rather than hardcoded in the application.

## Deployment Verification

After each deployment:

1. Verify the playground loads correctly
2. Test agent interactions with both scripted and LLM modes (if enabled)
3. Confirm governance features function as expected
4. Check that metrics are displayed correctly
5. Ensure export functionality works

If any issues are detected, use Render's rollback feature immediately to restore service while investigating the problem.
