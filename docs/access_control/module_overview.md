# Access Tier Management System Overview

## Introduction

The Access Tier Management System is a core component of Phase 6.3's Phased API Exposure framework. It provides a comprehensive solution for controlling and managing access to Promethios APIs across multiple tiers, enabling a controlled, progressive release strategy.

## Architecture

The Access Tier Management System consists of the following components:

### 1. Access Tier Registry

A centralized database that tracks:
- Defined access tiers (developer preview, partner access, public beta, general availability)
- Permission sets associated with each tier
- User and organization assignments to specific tiers
- Access history and tier progression

### 2. API Gateway Integration

Middleware components that:
- Enforce access controls at the API gateway level
- Validate authentication tokens and extract tier information
- Apply tier-specific rate limits and quotas
- Log access attempts and policy violations

### 3. Progressive Access Workflow

A system that:
- Defines criteria for advancing users through access tiers
- Monitors usage patterns and feedback
- Automates tier progression when criteria are met
- Provides administrative tools for manual tier adjustments

### 4. Usage Quota Management

Mechanisms that:
- Define and enforce tier-specific rate limits
- Track API usage against quotas
- Implement graceful degradation when quotas are exceeded
- Provide usage analytics and forecasting

## Implementation Details

### Authentication and Authorization

The system uses JWT-based authentication with:
- Tier information encoded in tokens
- Scope-based permissions for fine-grained access control
- Token validation at the API gateway
- Integration with identity providers for user authentication

### Data Model

The core data model includes:

```
AccessTier:
  - id: string
  - name: string
  - description: string
  - permissions: Permission[]
  - rate_limits: RateLimit[]
  - progression_criteria: ProgressionCriteria[]

TierAssignment:
  - id: string
  - user_id: string
  - organization_id: string (optional)
  - tier_id: string
  - assigned_at: timestamp
  - expires_at: timestamp (optional)
  - assigned_by: string
  - status: enum (active, suspended, expired)

AccessLog:
  - id: string
  - user_id: string
  - endpoint: string
  - timestamp: timestamp
  - status: enum (success, denied, quota_exceeded)
  - request_details: object
```

### API Endpoints

The Access Tier Management System exposes the following administrative endpoints:

- `GET /admin/tiers`: List all access tiers
- `POST /admin/tiers`: Create a new access tier
- `GET /admin/tiers/{tier_id}`: Get tier details
- `PUT /admin/tiers/{tier_id}`: Update tier details
- `GET /admin/assignments`: List tier assignments
- `POST /admin/assignments`: Create a new tier assignment
- `PUT /admin/assignments/{assignment_id}`: Update a tier assignment
- `GET /admin/usage`: Get usage statistics

## Integration Points

The Access Tier Management System integrates with:

1. **API Gateway**: For enforcing access controls
2. **Identity Provider**: For user authentication
3. **Telemetry System**: For usage tracking and analytics
4. **Developer Portal**: For tier status display and progression
5. **Notification System**: For communicating tier changes

## Configuration

The system is configured through:

```json
{
  "tiers": [
    {
      "id": "developer_preview",
      "name": "Developer Preview",
      "description": "Limited access for early developers",
      "permissions": ["read:basic", "write:basic"],
      "rate_limits": {
        "requests_per_minute": 60,
        "requests_per_day": 10000
      },
      "progression_criteria": {
        "min_days_in_tier": 30,
        "min_successful_requests": 1000,
        "max_error_rate": 0.05
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "partner_access",
      "name": "Partner Access",
      "description": "Extended access for official partners",
      "permissions": ["read:all", "write:basic", "write:advanced"],
      "rate_limits": {
        "requests_per_minute": 300,
        "requests_per_day": 50000
      },
      "progression_criteria": {
        "min_days_in_tier": 60,
        "min_successful_requests": 10000,
        "max_error_rate": 0.02
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "public_beta",
      "name": "Public Beta",
      "description": "Broader access during beta period",
      "permissions": ["read:all", "write:all"],
      "rate_limits": {
        "requests_per_minute": 600,
        "requests_per_day": 100000
      },
      "progression_criteria": {
        "min_days_in_tier": 90,
        "min_successful_requests": 50000,
        "max_error_rate": 0.01
      }
    },

      "permissions": ["read:all", "write:all", "admin:basic"],
      "rate_limits": {
        "requests_per_minute": 1200,
        "requests_per_day": 500000
      }
    }
  ],
  "gateway_integration": {
    "token_validation_endpoint": "/auth/validate",
    "rate_limit_headers": true,
    "detailed_error_responses": true
  },
  "progression": {
    "automatic_evaluation_interval": 86400,
    "notification_enabled": true
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

The Access Tier Management System implements several security measures:

1. **Token Security**: JWTs are signed and optionally encrypted
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users are granted only the permissions needed for their tier
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and ensures fair resource allocation
4. **Audit Logging**: All administrative actions are logged for accountability
5. **Expiration Policies**: Access can be time-limited with automatic expiration

## Monitoring and Metrics

The system tracks the following metrics:

1. **Active Users per Tier**: Number of active users in each tier
2. **Tier Progression Rate**: How quickly users advance through tiers
3. **Access Denial Rate**: Frequency of denied access attempts
4. **Quota Utilization**: How close users are to their quota limits
5. **Administrative Actions**: Frequency and types of admin interventions

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for future phases include:

1. **Machine Learning for Progression**: Automated tier advancement based on usage patterns
2. **Enhanced Fraud Detection**: Identifying and preventing API abuse
3. **Custom Tier Creation**: Allowing creation of custom tiers for specific partners
4. **Granular Permission Management**: More fine-grained control over API capabilities
5. **Integration with Billing Systems**: For monetization of API access
