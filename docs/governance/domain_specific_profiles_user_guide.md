# Domain-Specific Governance Profiles User Guide

## Introduction

The Promethios Domain-Specific Governance Profiles system allows you to customize governance parameters for different professional domains. This user guide will help you understand how to use and configure these profiles to optimize agent behavior for your specific needs.

## Getting Started

### Accessing Governance Profiles

You can access the governance profiles through the Promethios UI:

1. Navigate to the Governance section in the main menu
2. Select "Domain Profiles" from the submenu
3. You will see the profile selector with available domains

### Selecting a Domain

The system supports four professional domains:

- **Software Engineering**: Optimized for code review, development, and technical tasks
- **Product Management**: Optimized for market analysis, product planning, and roadmapping
- **Human Resources**: Optimized for personnel management, hiring, and HR operations
- **Administrative**: Optimized for document processing, scheduling, and administrative tasks

To select a domain:
1. Use the "Governance Domain" dropdown to choose your domain
2. The system will automatically load the appropriate profile
3. You'll see domain-specific metrics and recommendations

### Understanding Profile Metrics

Each domain profile includes specialized metrics:

#### Software Engineering
- **Code Quality Governance**: Minimum trust threshold for code operations
- **Technical Debt Management**: Depth of context preservation during recovery
- **Build Pipeline Governance**: Monitoring granularity for build processes

#### Product Management
- **Market Analysis Trust**: Minimum trust threshold for market analysis
- **Planning Efficiency**: Monitoring granularity for planning processes
- **Decision Recovery**: Maximum recovery attempts for decision processes

#### Human Resources
- **Personnel Trust**: Minimum trust threshold for personnel operations
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Monitoring granularity for compliance processes
- **Data Preservation**: Depth of state preservation for sensitive HR data

#### Administrative
- **Document Processing Trust**: Minimum trust threshold for document operations
- **Process Efficiency**: Streamlined monitoring for administrative processes
- **Recovery Simplicity**: Optimized recovery attempts for administrative tasks

### Comparing Domains

You can compare metrics across different domains:

1. Select your primary domain
2. Enable the comparison view using the "Compare Domains" toggle
3. Select additional domains for comparison
4. The system will display a side-by-side comparison of key metrics

## Advanced Usage

### Selecting Profile Versions

Each domain can have multiple profile versions:

1. Select your domain
2. Use the "Profile Version" dropdown to choose a specific version
3. The system will load the selected version

The default "6.4.0" version is optimized based on benchmark results, while the "pre-6.4" version provides backward compatibility with earlier behavior.

### Customizing Profiles

Advanced users can customize profile parameters:

1. Select your domain and version
2. Click "Customize Profile"
3. Adjust parameters in the following categories:
   - Trust Metrics
   - Monitoring Configuration
   - Recovery Mechanisms
   - Loop State Management
4. Click "Save Profile" to apply your changes

### Domain Detection

The system can automatically detect the appropriate domain based on your current task:

1. Enable "Auto-detect Domain" in the settings
2. The system will analyze your current task context
3. The appropriate domain profile will be automatically selected

## Troubleshooting

### Profile Not Loading

If a profile fails to load:

1. Check your network connection
2. Try selecting the domain again
3. If the issue persists, the system will fall back to default profiles

### Metrics Not Updating

If metrics don't update after changing domains:

1. Refresh the page
2. Clear browser cache
3. Ensure you have the latest version of the application
