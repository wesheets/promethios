# Domain-Specific Governance Profiles Documentation

## Overview

This document provides technical documentation for the domain-specific governance profiles system implemented in Phase 6.5 of the Promethios project. The system allows for customized governance parameters across different professional domains, optimizing trust metrics, monitoring granularity, and recovery mechanisms based on benchmark testing results.

## Architecture

The domain-specific governance profiles system consists of the following components:

1. **Core Types and Interfaces**: Defines the structure of governance profiles and domains
2. **Context Provider**: Manages profile selection, persistence, and domain detection
3. **API Service Layer**: Handles communication with the governance backend
4. **Domain-Specific Components**: Specialized UI components for each professional domain
5. **Profile Selection**: UI for selecting and configuring governance profiles

## Core Types and Interfaces

The system supports four primary domains:

- Software Engineering
- Product Management
- Human Resources
- Administrative

Each domain has a specialized governance profile with the following configuration areas:

- **Trust Metrics**: Controls trust decay rates, thresholds, and recovery rates
- **Monitoring**: Defines event granularity and reporting frequency
- **Recovery**: Configures state preservation depth and recovery attempts
- **Loop State**: Manages termination states and custom state transitions

## API Integration

The governance profiles system integrates with the backend API through the `GovernanceApiService` class, which provides methods for:

- Fetching available profiles
- Selecting profiles by domain and version
- Saving modified profiles
- Retrieving governance metrics

The service includes fallback mechanisms to default profiles when the API is unavailable, ensuring robustness.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { GovernanceProfileProvider, useGovernanceProfile } from '@governance';
import { GovernanceDomain } from '@governance/types';

// Wrap your application with the provider
<GovernanceProfileProvider initialDomain={GovernanceDomain.SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING}>
  <YourApp />
</GovernanceProfileProvider>

// Use the hook in your components
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { currentProfile, selectProfile } = useGovernanceProfile();
  
  // Access profile data
  console.log(currentProfile.trustMetrics.minTrustThreshold);
  
  // Change domain
  selectProfile(GovernanceDomain.PRODUCT_MANAGEMENT);
  
  return <div>...</div>;
};
```

### Domain-Specific Components

Each domain has a specialized component that automatically selects the appropriate profile:

```tsx
import { SoftwareEngineeringProfile } from '@domains';

// The component will automatically select the Software Engineering domain
<SoftwareEngineeringProfile showMetrics={true} />
```

## Benchmark Results

The domain-specific profiles are optimized based on benchmark testing results:

- **Software Engineering**: Slight performance decrease (-4.3%) and quality decrease (-10.7%), but trust maintained
- **Product Management**: Performance improvement (+9.3%) with minor quality decrease (-5.7%)
- **Human Resources**: Performance decrease (-10.7%) but trust score improvement (+6.1%)
- **Administrative**: Performance improvement (+5.0%) and trust improvement (+3.7%)

## Extension Points

The system is designed for extensibility:

1. **New Domains**: Additional domains can be added by extending the `GovernanceDomain` enum
2. **Custom Metrics**: The metrics visualization can be extended with domain-specific visualizations
3. **Profile Versions**: Multiple versions of profiles can coexist for backward compatibility

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive testing:

- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for API communication
- Mock services for testing without backend dependencies

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for future phases:

1. Machine learning-based domain detection
2. Dynamic profile adjustment based on task context
3. Collaborative profile editing and sharing
4. Historical metrics visualization and trend analysis
