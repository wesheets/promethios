# Phase 5.1 Completion Report: External Trigger Integration

## Overview

This document reports the successful implementation of Phase 5.1 (External Trigger Integration) for the Promethios kernel. The implementation enables loop triggering via multiple interfaces: CLI, webhooks, and embedded SaaS flows, as specified in the Codex Contract.

## Implementation Details

### Contract Information
- **Contract Version**: v2025.05.18
- **Phase ID**: 5.1
- **Title**: External Trigger Integration
- **Description**: Enable loop triggering via CLI, webhook, or embedded SaaS flows
- **Clauses**: 6.1, 6.06, 5.2
- **Schema Registry**: 
  - external_trigger.schema.v1.json
  - webhook_payload.schema.v1.json
  - cli_args.schema.v1.json

### Components Implemented

#### 1. Schema Files
All required schema files have been added to the `/schemas` directory:
- `external_trigger.schema.v1.json`: Defines the structure for external trigger metadata and configuration
- `webhook_payload.schema.v1.json`: Defines the structure for webhook trigger payloads
- `cli_args.schema.v1.json`: Defines the structure for CLI trigger arguments

#### 2. CLI Trigger Implementation
Created `cli_trigger.py` in the root directory with the following features:
- Command-line argument parsing and validation
- Schema validation against `cli_args.schema.v1.json`
- Pre-loop tether checks to ensure Codex compliance
- Trigger payload creation and validation against `external_trigger.schema.v1.json`
- Loop execution via API call
- Result handling and output

#### 3. API Server Updates
Updated `runtime_executor.py` with the following additions:
- Added constants for `SCHEMA_DIR`, `CONTRACT_VERSION`, and `PHASE_ID`
- Implemented helper functions for schema loading and validation
- Added `pre_loop_tether_check()` function for contract verification
- Implemented `handle_external_trigger()` method for processing external triggers
- Added trigger logging functionality
- Ensured all trigger metadata is properly passed to the loop execution

#### 4. Webhook Trigger Implementation
Added webhook trigger functionality to `runtime_executor.py`:
- Implemented `handle_webhook_trigger()` method
- Added authentication token validation
- Added webhook payload validation against `webhook_payload.schema.v1.json`
- Implemented callback handling for asynchronous notifications
- Added support for explicit trigger IDs to improve testability

#### 5. SaaS Flow Integration
Created `saas_connector.py` with the following features:
- Implemented `SaaSConnector` class for SaaS platform integration
- Added methods for triggering loops from various SaaS platforms (Zapier, Make, n8n)
- Implemented payload validation and tether checks
- Added error handling and result processing

#### 6. UI Integration
Updated the UI to display trigger history:
- Added `trigger_history.html` template
- Created JavaScript for trigger history filtering and modal functionality
- Updated Flask app to support trigger history routes and API endpoints
- Added navigation links to the trigger history page

#### 7. Testing
Created comprehensive test cases in `test_external_trigger.py`:
- Tests for external trigger endpoint
- Tests for webhook trigger endpoint
- Tests for invalid contract version handling
- Tests for callback functionality

## Codex Compliance Verification

All implementation components have been verified for Codex compliance:

1. **Schema Files**: All required schema files are present in the `/schemas` directory and match the implementation plan.
2. **Codex Contract Tethering**: The `.codex.lock` file has been updated with the correct contract version and phase ID.
3. **Code References**: All implementation code includes explicit references to the contract version and phase ID.
4. **Pre-Loop Tether Checks**: Tether checks are implemented in all trigger mechanisms to ensure governance integrity.
5. **Schema Validation**: Schema validation is performed at all entry points to maintain data integrity.

## Testing Results

All test cases have been executed successfully, verifying the correct functionality of:
- External trigger endpoint
- Webhook trigger endpoint
- Contract tethering verification
- Schema validation
- Callback handling

## Conclusion

The Phase 5.1 implementation successfully extends the Promethios kernel's capabilities to allow external systems to trigger loop execution through multiple interfaces. All components have been implemented according to the Codex Contract Tethering Protocol, maintaining governance integrity and preventing drift.

The implementation is now ready for integration with external systems and can be used to trigger loop execution from CLI tools, webhooks, and SaaS platforms.
