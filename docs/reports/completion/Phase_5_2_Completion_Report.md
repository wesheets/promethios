# Phase 5.2 Completion Report: Replay Reproducibility Seal

## Overview
This report documents the implementation of Phase 5.2 (Replay Reproducibility Seal) for the Promethios project. The implementation enables deterministic execution, replay sealing, and verification of execution integrity, ensuring that all executions can be reproduced and verified for compliance with the Codex Contract Tethering Protocol.

## Contract Information
- **Contract Version:** v2025.05.18
- **Phase ID:** 5.2
- **Title:** Replay Reproducibility Seal
- **Description:** Implement deterministic execution and cryptographic sealing for reproducible verification

## Implementation Components

### 1. Schema Files
Three new schema files have been added to the `/schemas` directory:
- `replay_seal.schema.v1.json`: Defines the structure of execution seals
- `execution_log.schema.v1.json`: Defines the structure of execution logs
- `deterministic_replay.schema.v1.json`: Defines the structure of replay configuration

### 2. Replay Sealing (`replay_sealing.py`)
The Replay Sealer component is responsible for:
- Creating cryptographic seals for executions
- Computing hashes for inputs, outputs, and the complete execution log
- Validating seals against the schema
- Storing seals in a persistent format

Key features:
- SHA-256 hashing for all cryptographic operations
- Canonical JSON representation for consistent hashing
- Schema validation for all seals
- Proper hash chain implementation with previous hash references

### 3. Deterministic Execution Manager (`deterministic_execution.py`)
The Deterministic Execution Manager is responsible for:
- Initializing execution environments with controlled randomness
- Logging all inputs, outputs, and state transitions
- Managing the execution log with proper hash chaining
- Finalizing executions and generating seals

Key features:
- Controlled random seed initialization
- Chronological event logging with hash chaining
- Support for various trigger types (CLI, webhook, API)
- Execution replay capability with configurable parameters

### 4. Seal Verification Service (`seal_verification.py`)
The Seal Verification Service is responsible for:
- Verifying the integrity of execution seals
- Comparing original executions with replays
- Validating hash chains in execution logs
- Listing all executions with their seals

Key features:
- Complete hash verification for inputs, outputs, and logs
- Hash chain integrity validation
- Detailed verification reporting
- Execution comparison for replay validation

### 5. Runtime Executor Integration (`runtime_executor.py`)
The Runtime Executor has been updated to integrate Phase 5.2 functionality:
- Added support for external triggers with sealing
- Implemented webhook trigger handling with callbacks
- Added seal verification endpoints
- Integrated deterministic execution with the core loop

## Codex Compliance Verification

### Pre-Loop Tether Check
All components implement the pre-loop tether check to verify:
- Contract version (v2025.05.18) in the .codex.lock file
- Phase ID (5.2) in the .codex.lock file
- Required schema files referenced in the .codex.lock file
- Schema files exist in the schemas directory

### Schema Validation
All data structures are validated against their respective schemas:
- Execution logs against execution_log.schema.v1.json
- Seals against replay_seal.schema.v1.json
- Replay configurations against deterministic_replay.schema.v1.json
- External triggers against external_trigger.schema.v1.json
- Webhook payloads against webhook_payload.schema.v1.json

### Hash Chain Integrity
The implementation ensures hash chain integrity through:
- Sequential entry IDs
- Previous hash references in each entry
- Current hash computation based on entry content and previous hash
- Verification of the complete hash chain during seal verification

## Testing

### Test Suite
A comprehensive test suite (`test_phase_5_2.py`) has been created to verify:
- Schema validation for all components
- Replay sealing functionality
- Deterministic execution with various trigger types
- Seal verification and comparison
- Integration with the runtime executor

### Test Results
All tests are passing, confirming that the implementation is fully compliant with the Codex Contract Tethering Protocol and meets all requirements for Phase 5.2.

## Conclusion
The Phase 5.2 implementation successfully adds deterministic execution, replay sealing, and verification capabilities to the Promethios project. These features ensure that all executions can be reproduced and verified for compliance with the Codex Contract Tethering Protocol, enhancing the system's governance integrity and auditability.

The implementation strictly adheres to the Codex Contract Tethering Protocol, with proper schema validation, pre-loop tether checks, and hash chain integrity verification throughout the execution lifecycle.
