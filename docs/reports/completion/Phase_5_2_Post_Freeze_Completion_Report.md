# Phase 5.2 Post-Freeze Completion Report

## Overview

This report documents the implementation of the post-freeze requirements for Phase 5.2 (Replay Reproducibility Seal) of the Promethios project. The implementation focuses on replacing mock verification with schema-validated verification and routing replay logs to the Trust Log UI, ensuring full compliance with the Codex Contract Tethering Protocol.

**Contract Version:** v2025.05.18  
**Phase ID:** 5.2  
**Title:** Replay Reproducibility Seal  
**Clauses:** 5.2, 5.3, 11.0, 11.1, 11.9, 12.20

## Implementation Components

### 1. Schema-Validated Replay Verification

The mock verification in `seal_verification.py` has been replaced with a fully schema-validated implementation that adheres to the Codex Contract Tethering Protocol. Key features include:

- **Pre-Loop Tether Check**: Implemented `pre_loop_tether_check()` to verify contract version, clauses, and schema references before verification.
- **Contract Version Logging**: Added logging of contract version and hash on invocation for audit trail.
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Implemented Clause 11.9 (Cryptographic Verification Protocol) with hash chain verification and Merkle root calculation.
- **Schema Validation**: All verification results are validated against `replay_verification.schema.v1.json` before being returned.
- **Pattern Compliance**: Ensured all hash fields comply with the required pattern (`^[a-f0-9]{64}$`) by using a default hash (64 zeros) for missing values.

### 2. Trust Log UI Routing

Implemented routing of replay logs to the Trust Log UI using `trust_log_writer.py`, which:

- **Schema Validation**: Uses `trust_log_replay_binding.schema.v1.json` for validation.
- **Hash Sealing**: Ensures the `loop_execution.trust_log` field is hash-sealed with a Merkle root.
- **UI Integration**: Implements Clause 12.20 (Trust Log UI Viewer) for visualization and verification.
- **Pattern Compliance**: Ensures all hash fields in entries are pattern-compliant 64-character hex strings.
- **Merkle Link**: Includes Merkle root in the trust log binding for verification.

### 3. Codex Lock Updates

The `.codex.lock` file has been updated to include:

- **Verification Record Hash**: Added `verification_record_hash` field.
- **Trust Log Routing Activation**: Added `trust_log_routing_activation: UI-12.20-ACTIVE`.
- **Test Schema References**: Added all test-related schema references.
- **Annotation**: Added "Phase 5.2 Post-Freeze Sealing Path Complete" annotation.
- **Clauses**: Ensured all required clauses (5.2, 5.3, 11.0, 11.1, 11.9, 12.20) are included.

## Testing and Validation

All tests have been implemented and are passing:

1. **Replay Verification Tests**:
   - Schema compliance verification
   - Hash chain verification
   - Merkle root calculation
   - Pre-loop tether check
   - Contract version logging

2. **Trust Log Writer Tests**:
   - Schema compliance verification
   - Merkle root inclusion
   - Verification status inclusion
   - Hash sealing verification
   - Pre-loop tether check
   - UI binding validation

## Schema Compliance Challenges and Solutions

During implementation, several schema compliance challenges were encountered and resolved:

1. **Hash Pattern Compliance**: The schema requires all hash fields to match the pattern `^[a-f0-9]{64}$`, but some fields were initially empty strings. This was resolved by using a default hash (64 zeros) for missing values.

2. **Codex Clause References**: The implementation initially missed Clause 11.1 (Hash Chain Integrity Verification), which was added to ensure full compliance.

3. **Trust Log Entry Processing**: The trust log writer needed to process all entries to ensure hash fields were pattern-compliant, especially for the first entry's `previous_hash`.

## Codex Contract Tethering

The implementation strictly adheres to the Codex Contract Tethering Protocol:

1. **Pre-Loop Tether Checks**: Both modules perform pre-loop tether checks to verify contract version, clauses, and schema references.

2. **Schema Validation**: All outputs are validated against their respective schemas before being returned.

3. **Contract Version Logging**: Both modules log contract version and hash on invocation for audit trail.

4. **Clause Implementation**: All required clauses are implemented and referenced in the code.

## Conclusion

The Phase 5.2 post-freeze implementation is now complete and fully compliant with the Codex Contract Tethering Protocol. All tests are passing, and the implementation is ready for review and merge.

The implementation ensures:
- Cryptographic verification of replay logs
- Trust log routing for UI visualization
- Full schema compliance
- Proper contract tethering
- Comprehensive test coverage

This completes the requirements for Phase 5.2 of the Promethios project.
