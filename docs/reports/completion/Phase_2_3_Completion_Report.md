# Promethios Phase 2.3: Audit Readiness - Replay Logging, Operator Observability, and Kernel Integration - Completion Report

**Date:** May 13, 2025

**Phase Objective:** To enhance the Promethios system with robust audit readiness capabilities, including reliable replay logging, operator observability tools, and seamless kernel integration for consistent data capture and validation.

## 1. Summary of Accomplishments

Phase 2.3 has been successfully completed. All planned tasks, including kernel integration, SHA256 hash verification, and the development of specified observability and validator/reporting tools, have been finalized. The system now reliably captures, validates, and logs emotion telemetry and justification data with the actual `GovernanceCore` kernel. A suite of command-line tools has been developed to support log management, schema compliance, component usage analysis, and deterministic replay testing.

Key accomplishments include:

*   **Successful Kernel Integration:** The `runtime_executor.py` now correctly integrates with the actual `GovernanceCore` kernel, ensuring that all logging and validation processes utilize the definitive kernel logic. The `PROMETHIOS_KERNEL_PATH` environment variable is respected for specifying the kernel location.
*   **Validated Logging:** Both emotion telemetry and justification logs are being successfully captured, validated against their respective Resurrection Codex schemas, and emitted by the kernel. The `entry_sha256_hash` is correctly generated and included in each log entry.
*   **SHA256 Hash Verification:** The `verify_log_hashes.py` script (developed in an earlier part of this phase) has been confirmed to work with the logs generated by the actual kernel, ensuring log integrity.
*   **CLI Observability Tool (`view_logs.py`):** A command-line tool for viewing and filtering formatted log entries from emotion telemetry, justification logs, and operator override logs has been implemented and tested. It supports filtering by request ID, log type, and number of recent entries.
*   **Validator & Reporting Tools Suite:**
    *   **Log Collection & Packaging Utility (`package_logs.py`):** This tool allows for the collection and packaging of specified log entries (emotion and justification) into a ZIP archive based on criteria such as request IDs, date ranges, number of recent loops, or override status.
    *   **Schema Validation Reporting Tool (`validate_schema_compliance.py`):** This tool validates log entries from `.jsonl` files or ZIP archives against their corresponding Resurrection Codex JSON schemas and generates a compliance report.
    *   **Component Inventory & Invocation Analysis Tool (`analyze_component_usage.py`):** This tool analyzes justification logs and a (simplified) Codex manifest to report on component and schema usage, highlighting any discrepancies.
    *   **Deterministic Replay Test Harness (`test_deterministic_replay.py`):** This tool facilitates testing the deterministic replay capability of the `/loop/execute` endpoint by running two identical requests and comparing the SHA256 hashes of the generated log entries.
*   **Resolution of Blockers:** The critical blocker related to justification log schema validation (incorrect `schema_versions` key names) within the kernel was successfully resolved through iterative testing and kernel updates provided by Architect Manus.
*   **Documentation:** The `todo_phase_2_3.md` has been meticulously updated throughout the phase, tracking all tasks and their completion status.

## 2. Key Issues Encountered and Resolutions

*   **Initial Justification Log Validation Failure:** The primary challenge was the kernel's internal schema validation failure for justification logs due to incorrect key names in the `schema_versions` object. This was resolved by using the corrected `governance_core.py` provided by Architect Manus.
*   **Runtime Executor Kernel Path:** An issue where `runtime_executor.py` was loading a mock kernel instead of the actual kernel was identified and resolved by ensuring the `PROMETHIOS_KERNEL_PATH` environment variable was correctly set and utilized during testing.
*   **Python Dependencies:** A `jsonschema` dependency was missing and was installed.
*   **Tooling Script Errors:** Minor syntax errors (f-string formatting, argparse configuration) were identified in `analyze_component_usage.py` during development and testing, and were promptly corrected.

## 3. Outstanding Observations

*   **Secondary Kernel Emotion Telemetry Validation:** A secondary observation remains: the kernel shows an internal `Schema Validation Error for 'emotion_telemetry': 'factor' is a required property` when processing a `trust_factor` (Scenario 3 in the `runtime_executor.py` test script). This was deemed non-blocking for the primary goals of Phase 2.3 but should be noted for future kernel refinement.
