# Promethios UI and Replay Script Cleanup & Verification Report (Final)

## Executive Summary

This report documents the successful cleanup of duplicate scripts, verification of UI functionality, and resolution of all identified issues including the manual replay path and Log Integrity Check display for the Promethios system. All tests have passed, and the UI is now confirmed to be fully operational when hosted within the Linux sandbox environment, making it ready for the developer demo.

## Key Issues Addressed & Resolved

1.  **Duplicate `test_deterministic_replay.py` Script:** A redundant copy of the script within the UI source directory was identified and removed.
2.  **Unused `static/index.html`:** An unused `index.html` file in the UI static directory was identified and removed.
3.  **Manual Replay Path Issue (Initial):** Clarified that the UI Flask server being run on Windows caused path mismatches. Solution: Run UI server in the Linux sandbox.
4.  **Manual Replay Path Issue (Sandbox - `REPO_ROOT`):** The `REPO_ROOT` in `promethios_ui_surface/src/config.py` was incorrectly resolving to `/home/ubuntu/` instead of `/home/ubuntu/promethios_clean_pr/`. This was corrected to use `os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "..", ".."))` ensuring it correctly points to the project root.
5.  **Manual Replay Path Issue (Loop Input Path):** The UI was not correctly handling an empty "Loop input path" and was also too restrictive in validating the path. This was corrected in `promethios_ui_surface/src/main.py` to allow paths relative to `REPO_ROOT` (like `sample_logs/`) and to correctly handle empty inputs.
6.  **Log Integrity Check UI Error ("File Not Found"):** The UI was not correctly parsing the manifest and validating against the log entries. This was fixed by updating the logic in `promethios_ui_surface/src/main.py` in the `integrity_check()` route to correctly read embedded hashes from log entries.

## Cleanup Actions Performed

1.  **Deleted Duplicate Replay Script:**
    *   Removed: `/home/ubuntu/promethios_clean_pr/promethios_ui_surface/src/test_deterministic_replay.py`
    *   Canonical script retained: `/home/ubuntu/promethios_clean_pr/test_deterministic_replay.py`
2.  **Deleted Unused Static `index.html`:**
    *   Removed: `/home/ubuntu/promethios_clean_pr/promethios_ui_surface/src/static/index.html`
3.  **Corrected `REPO_ROOT` in `config.py`:** Updated logic for dynamic and correct repository root path resolution.
4.  **Corrected Path Validation and Empty Input Handling in `main.py` (replay route):** Updated logic for `loop_input_json_path`.
5.  **Corrected Manifest Parsing in `main.py` (integrity_check route):** Updated logic to correctly read embedded hashes from log files based on the manifest.

## UI Server Setup and Testing in Sandbox (Final)

1.  **Dependencies Installed:** Ensured Flask and other UI dependencies were installed.
2.  **UI Server Started:** The Promethios UI Flask server (`promethios_ui_surface/src/main.py`) was successfully started within the Linux sandbox environment after all fixes.
3.  **Port Exposed:** The UI server (running on port 5001) is accessible via the public URL: `https://5001-i8bvxbn9v5obisjvn0gf4-163e53ab.manus.computer`
4.  **UI Navigation and Feature Testing (All Passed):
    *   **Home Page:** Loaded successfully.
    *   **Emotion Telemetry Logs:** Loaded successfully, displaying generated logs.
    *   **Justification Logs:** Loaded successfully, displaying generated logs.
    *   **Manual Replay Page:** Loaded successfully. Tested with `sample_logs/deterministic_replay_input_audit_replay_test_20250513175517_30242d76.json` (and empty loop input), replay executed successfully, and logs were generated.
    *   **Log Integrity Check:** Loaded successfully. After all fixes and log regeneration, all entries for `emotion_telemetry.log.jsonl` and `justification.log.jsonl` correctly show **Status: Valid**.

## Log Regeneration and Verification (Final)

1.  **Deterministic Replay Rerun:**
    *   Cleared old logs and manifest.
    *   Successfully executed `test_deterministic_replay.py` to regenerate `emotion_telemetry.log.jsonl` and `justification.log.jsonl`.
2.  **Schema and Hash Integrity Re-validation:**
    *   **Hash Integrity (`verify_log_hashes.py --generate`):**
        *   Emotion Telemetry Log: PASSED
        *   Justification Log: PASSED
        *   SHA256 manifest successfully regenerated.
    *   **Schema Validation (`validate_schema.py`):**
        *   Emotion Telemetry Log: PASSED (all entries conform to schema)
        *   Justification Log: PASSED (all entries conform to schema)
        *   OVERALL: All logs conform to required schemas.

## Conclusion

The Promethios system, including the UI Justification Surface, has been successfully debugged, cleaned up, and verified. All identified issues have been addressed. The system is now in a consistent, fully functional, and demo-ready state when the UI server is hosted within the Linux sandbox environment.

The public URL for accessing the UI (running in the sandbox) is: `https://5001-i8bvxbn9v5obisjvn0gf4-163e53ab.manus.computer`

This URL can be provided to the developer for the demo.

## Next Steps

1.  Notify the user of these cleanup actions and test results.
2.  Ensure all code changes (`config.py`, `main.py`) and file deletions are committed and pushed.
3.  Update the PR description and deliverables.
4.  Request final user review and approval.
