# Phase 12.20 Implementation Documentation

## Trust Log UI Viewer Implementation

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the Phase 12.20 (Trust Log UI Viewer) implementation for the Promethios project. The implementation strictly adheres to the Codex Contract Tethering Protocol and ensures that all UI components are properly tethered to the contract before rendering.

### Contract Reference

- **Contract Version:** v2025.05.18
- **Phase ID:** 12.20
- **Title:** Trust Log UI Viewer
- **Clauses:** 5.3, 11.0, 12.0, 6.2
- **Schema Registry:** trust_view.schema.v1.json

### Implementation Overview

The Trust Log UI Viewer provides a comprehensive visualization of execution replay logs, Merkle seals, and trust surfaces. It consists of the following components:

1. **Main Trust Log UI Component**
   - Tab-based interface for switching between different views
   - Pre-loop tether check enforcement
   - Clause citation display
   - Responsive design

2. **Replay Log Viewer**
   - Displays execution replay logs
   - Schema validation for all data
   - Clause 5.3 citation

3. **Merkle Chain Visualizer**
   - Displays Merkle seals for cryptographic verification
   - Schema validation for all data
   - Clause 11.0 citation

4. **Trust Surface Display**
   - Displays trust scores, justifications, and override status
   - Schema validation for all data
   - Clause 6.2 citation

5. **Utilities**
   - Pre-loop tether check utility
   - Schema validation utility
   - API client for data fetching

### Governance Enforcement

All UI components implement strict governance enforcement:

1. **Pre-Loop Tether Checks**
   - Every component performs a tether check before rendering
   - Components verify contract version, clauses, and schema references
   - Components fail gracefully with clear error messages if tether check fails

2. **Schema Validation**
   - All data is validated against trust_view.schema.v1.json
   - Validation occurs before any data is rendered
   - Components fail gracefully with clear error messages if validation fails

3. **Clause Citations**
   - All components display the governing clauses
   - Citations include both the clause number and description
   - Footer displays all relevant clauses

4. **Read-Only Contract References**
   - All contract references are displayed as read-only elements
   - No user modification of contract data is possible

### Testing and Validation

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:

1. **Tether Check Tests**
   - Verify that components perform tether checks
   - Verify that components fail gracefully if tether check fails

2. **Schema Validation Tests**
   - Verify that components validate data against schema
   - Verify that components fail gracefully if validation fails

3. **UI Component Tests**
   - Verify that components render correctly
   - Verify that tab navigation works
   - Verify that clause citations are displayed

### Codex Compliance

The implementation strictly adheres to the Codex Contract Tethering Protocol:

1. **Contract Version Verification**
   - All components verify contract version v2025.05.18
   - Components fail if contract version doesn't match

2. **Clause Verification**
   - All components verify required clauses (5.3, 11.0, 12.0, 6.2)
   - Components fail if any required clause is missing

3. **Schema Verification**
   - All components verify trust_view.schema.v1.json
   - Components fail if schema is missing or invalid

4. **Governance Display**
   - All components display governing clauses
   - UI clearly indicates which clauses govern which components

### Conclusion

The Phase 12.20 implementation provides a comprehensive Trust Log UI Viewer that strictly adheres to the Codex Contract Tethering Protocol. All components are properly tethered to the contract, all data is schema-validated, and all governance requirements are enforced.
