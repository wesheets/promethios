# Developer Sandbox Environment Overview

## Introduction

The Developer Sandbox Environment provides a safe, isolated environment for developers to experiment with Promethios APIs without affecting production systems. It enables developers to test integrations, explore API capabilities, and validate their implementations before deploying to production environments.

## Architecture

The Developer Sandbox Environment consists of the following components:

### 1. Sandbox API Endpoints

Isolated instances of all API endpoints that:
- Mirror the production API structure
- Operate on isolated data stores
- Support the full range of API functionality
- Provide detailed debugging information

### 2. Test Data Generator

Tools for creating realistic test data that:
- Generate synthetic agent interactions
- Create governance scenarios
- Simulate trust decay and recovery
- Produce realistic metrics and telemetry

### 3. Scenario Simulator

Pre-configured scenarios for testing specific use cases:
- Governance policy enforcement
- Trust boundary violations
- Multi-agent interactions
- Error and exception handling

### 4. Reset Functionality

Ability to reset sandbox state to a clean configuration:
- On-demand environment resets
- Scheduled automatic resets
- Partial resets of specific components
- Snapshot and restore capabilities

## Implementation Details

### Containerization

The sandbox uses:
- Containerized deployment for isolation
- Resource limits to prevent abuse
- Network isolation for security
- Ephemeral storage for test data

### Data Isolation

The sandbox implements:
- Separate databases for each developer
- Isolated agent instances
- Segregated trust logs and metrics
- Non-persistent sensitive data

### Monitoring and Debugging

The sandbox provides:
- Enhanced logging for all operations
- Request/response inspection tools
- Performance metrics collection
- Error tracing and visualization

## Integration Points

The Developer Sandbox Environment integrates with:

1. **Access Tier Management System**: For controlling sandbox access
2. **Developer Portal**: For sandbox provisioning and management
3. **Client Libraries**: For testing library functionality
4. **Feedback System**: For collecting developer feedback
5. **Telemetry System**: For monitoring sandbox usage

## API Endpoints

The Sandbox Environment exposes the following management endpoints:

- `POST /sandbox/provision`: Provision a new sandbox environment
- `POST /sandbox/reset`: Reset sandbox to initial state
- `GET /sandbox/status`: Get current sandbox status
- `POST /sandbox/scenario/{scenario_id}`: Load a pre-configured scenario
- `GET /sandbox/logs`: Retrieve sandbox operation logs

## Configuration

The sandbox is configured through:

```json
{
  "environments": {
    "max_per_developer": 3,
    "idle_timeout_minutes": 60,
    "max_lifetime_hours": 24,
    "resource_limits": {
      "cpu_cores": 2,
      "memory_mb": 4096,
      "storage_gb": 10,
      "requests_per_minute": 300
    }
  },
  "scenarios": {
    "available": [
      "basic_governance",
      "trust_decay",
      "multi_agent_collaboration",
      "error_handling",
      "compliance_verification"
    ],
    "default": "basic_governance"
  },
  "test_data": {
    "synthetic_agents": 5,
    "pre_populated_policies": true,
    "sample_trust_logs": true,
    "historical_metrics": true
  },
  "monitoring": {
    "detailed_logging": true,
    "performance_metrics": true,
    "error_tracking": true
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

The Developer Sandbox Environment implements several security measures:

1. **Isolation**: Complete isolation between developer environments
2. **Resource Limits**: Prevention of resource exhaustion attacks
3. **Data Sanitization**: Removal of sensitive data from test datasets
4. **Access Controls**: Strict authentication and authorization
5. **Automatic Expiration**: Time-limited sandbox instances

## Monitoring and Metrics

The sandbox tracks the following metrics:

1. **Environment Usage**: Active sandboxes and utilization patterns
2. **API Call Patterns**: Most frequently used endpoints and features
3. **Error Rates**: Common errors encountered by developers
4. **Resource Consumption**: CPU, memory, and storage utilization
5. **Scenario Popularity**: Most frequently used test scenarios

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for future phases include:

1. **Collaborative Sandboxes**: Shared environments for team development
2. **Custom Scenario Builder**: Tools for creating custom test scenarios
3. **Integration Testing Framework**: Automated testing of integrations
4. **Performance Testing Tools**: Load and stress testing capabilities
5. **Compliance Testing**: Validation against regulatory requirements
