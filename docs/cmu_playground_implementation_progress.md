# CMU Interactive Playground Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of the CMU Interactive Playground with real LLM-powered agent collaboration.

## Current Status
- âœ… Foundational architecture implemented
- âœ… Agent interface defined
- âœ… Scripted agent provider implemented
- âœ… LLM agent provider implemented
- âœ… Feature flag system implemented
- âœ… Developer panel for testing implemented
- âœ… Enhanced features module implemented
- ðŸ”„ Integration with main.js in progress
- ðŸ”„ Testing in development environment in progress

## Next Steps
1. Update main.js to use the new modular architecture
2. Implement backend API endpoints for LLM interaction
3. Test the feature-flagged implementation in development
4. Create documentation for developers and users
5. Deploy to staging environment for further testing

## Implementation Details

### Completed Components

#### Agent Interface
- Defines common interface for both scripted and LLM agents
- Provides methods for initialization, response generation, and governance application
- Ensures consistent behavior regardless of underlying implementation

#### Scripted Agent Provider
- Implements the agent interface with pre-scripted responses
- Serves as both the current implementation and fallback for LLM agents
- Simulates governance effects for demonstration purposes

#### LLM Agent Provider
- Implements the agent interface with LLM-powered responses
- Connects to LLM APIs for generating dynamic responses
- Applies real governance to responses
- Falls back to scripted responses when necessary

#### LLM Client
- Handles communication with LLM APIs
- Supports multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Includes fallback mechanisms for development and testing
- Manages API keys securely

#### Feature Flag System
- Provides centralized management of feature flags
- Enables gradual rollout of LLM integration
- Persists settings in localStorage for development
- Supports URL parameter overrides for testing

#### Developer Panel
- Provides UI for toggling feature flags
- Accessible via keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+D)
- Only visible in development mode or when explicitly enabled
- Allows testing of different configurations

#### Enhanced Features Module
- Provides additional features and enhancements
- Applied progressively based on feature flags
- Includes real-time governance visualization
- Enhances scenario selection and metrics dashboard

### In Progress Components

#### Main.js Integration
- Updating main.js to use the new modular architecture
- Ensuring backward compatibility with existing UI
- Adding feature flag checks for progressive rollout

#### Backend API Endpoints
- Implementing API endpoints for LLM interaction
- Setting up secure API key management
- Creating governance application endpoints

## Testing Plan
1. Unit testing of individual components
2. Integration testing of component interactions
3. End-to-end testing of full conversation flow
4. Performance testing of LLM integration
5. User acceptance testing with stakeholders

## Deployment Strategy
1. Deploy to development environment with feature flags disabled
2. Enable features incrementally for internal testing
3. Deploy to staging environment for broader testing
4. Roll out to production with feature flags disabled
5. Gradually enable features in production based on feedback
