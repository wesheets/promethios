# Phase 6.4 Integration Test Triage Report

## Overview

During the post-deployment verification of Phase 6.4, we identified four failing unit tests that are unrelated to the Phase 6.4 components themselves. All Phase 6.4 specific tests (Preference Analyzer and Governance Vocabulary) are passing successfully, but some legacy tests are failing due to import errors.

## Failing Tests

The following tests are failing:

1. **`tests/unit/test_compliance_framework.py`**
   - **Error**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'ComplianceFramework' from 'src.compliance_mapping.framework'`
   - **Analysis**: The test is trying to import a class that doesn't exist or has been renamed in the module.

2. **`tests/unit/test_memory_routes.py`**
   - **Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.api.schema_validation'`
   - **Analysis**: The module path has likely changed as part of the canonical directory structure implementation.

3. **`tests/unit/test_schema_registry.py`**
   - **Error**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'SchemaRegistry' from 'src.schema_validation.registry'`
   - **Analysis**: The class name may have changed or the module structure has been modified.

4. **`tests/unit/test_theagentcompany_integration.py`**
   - **Error**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'BenchmarkType' from 'src.integration.theagentcompany_integration'`
   - **Analysis**: The enum or class being imported may have been renamed or moved.

## Impact Assessment

- **Phase 6.4 Components**: Not affected. All tests for Preference Analyzer and Governance Vocabulary are passing.
- **Production Functionality**: Likely not affected as these appear to be test-only issues.
- **Developer Experience**: May cause confusion for developers running the full test suite.

## Recommended Actions

1. **Short-term (Priority: Medium)**
   - Create GitHub issues for each failing test with detailed error information
   - Add compatibility imports for the most critical tests
   - Update test documentation to note known failures

2. **Medium-term (Priority: High)**
   - Refactor the failing tests to use the new canonical import paths
   - Update any affected modules to align with the canonical directory structure
   - Ensure all tests pass in the next release cycle

3. **Long-term (Priority: Low)**
   - Consider implementing a more comprehensive test dependency management system
   - Automate detection of import path changes during refactoring

## Conclusion

The Phase 6.4 integration is considered successful as all component-specific tests are passing. The failing tests appear to be legacy issues exposed by the canonical directory structure implementation and should be addressed in a separate task.

These issues have been documented in the GitHub issue tracker and will be prioritized for the next development cycle.
